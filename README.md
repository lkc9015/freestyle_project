# Prerequisites
This NLP applications assumes you have installed Python 3.x for Windows and corresponding Pips. It may work, but is untested on Python 2.x and other operating systems.

# Installation
This application uses NumPy, scikit-learn and matplotlib libraries.
-  Numpy is a python library for support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

-  scikit-learn is a python library for machine learning.

-  Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library.
