Doc1,ACI Worldwide ,1996,"Ask most people their impression of Nebraska and, once they've stifled a yawn,their reply will have something to do with corn, football and the Strategic Air Command. But there is more to Nebraska - and OMAHA in particular - than first comes to mind. "
Doc2,ACI Worldwide ,1996," People making their living on Wall Street will immediately recognize the name Warren Buffet, but how many know he lives in Omaha? In addition to Warren, and almost as successful, is Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo - world class by anyone's definition. "
Doc3,ACI Worldwide ,1996, Our zoo has one of the world's largest free-flight aviaries and North America's largest facility for big cats. It also has an indoor rain forest - the world's largest - that houses more than 125 species of animals living among thousands of exotic plants. (The photograph of me on page five of this report was taken in the rain forest. I will explain the unique style of dress in a moment.) 
Doc4,ACI Worldwide ,1996," Another area that few people think of when they consider Nebraska is high technology. To amuse visitors, we sometimes call Omaha The Silicon Prairie. It is more than just a label, though. Omaha is home to companies like Inacom, CSG Systems, American Business Information, First Data and Transaction Systems Architects, Inc. (Nasdaq: TSAI). "
Doc5,ACI Worldwide ,1996," Transaction Systems contributes to The Silicon Prairie by building software that facilitates electronic commerce. Our products provide consumers and companies access to their money through the processing of transactions involving credit cards, debit cards, smart cards, home banking services, checks, wire transfers and automated clearing and settlement. Our software handled more than 12 billion automated teller machine and point-of-sale transactions last year. "
Doc6,ACI Worldwide ,1996," Many of our customers are the largest banks in the world. In fact, 106 of the top 500 banks worldwide (as measured by asset size) use a product built by Transaction Systems. As you can see from the chart on this page, we have plenty of opportunity among these large banks, many of which continue to use software they developed in the late 1970's or early 1980's. "
Doc7,ACI Worldwide ,1996," Also, our market niche is expanding with card-based transaction volumes increasing all over the world as growth in the use of cash and checks slows. The chart below documents one aspect of this trend in the United Kingdom. Because our software is priced in a volume-sensitive manner, we have benefited from this trend. In fiscal year 1996 we had revenues of $159.8 million, an increase of 35 percent over last year. Cash from record operating activities for the year totaled $17.7 million, up from $11.0 million. The company's cash balance at the end of September 1996 was $31.5 million. Our stock split two-for-one on July 1, 1996. "
Doc8,ACI Worldwide ,1996," But like the town in which we are headquartered, there is more to Transaction Systems than is immediately obvious. Our existing customers contribute more than 75 percent of our revenues in an average year through the purchase of additional capacity to handle increasing transaction volumes, the payment of maintenance fees and the licensing of new products. "
Doc9,ACI Worldwide ,1996," Our preferred pricing model is a monthly license fee which creates recurring revenues that enhance our long-term profitability. As of September 30, our level of monthly license fees had reached an annual run rate of $28 million. "
Doc10,ACI Worldwide ,1996," This type of pricing model helped us achieve a pro forma operating income (excluding acquisition-related charges) of $24 million in fiscal year 1996, up from $15.5 million last year. Our operating margin in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year reached 16 percent. "
Doc11,ACI Worldwide ,1996, Our approach to revenue recognition - typically recognizing revenue only after the products are installed - helps us maintain a rolling 12-month backlog of business. Our backlog grew 28 percent in fiscal 1996 reaching $105 million as of September 30. 
Doc12,ACI Worldwide ,1996, This backlog consisted of $34 million in non-recurring revenues and $71 million in recurring revenues. Backlog provides us with a visibility to our operations enjoyed by few software companies. This visibility allows us to reduce the volatility in our business. 
Doc13,ACI Worldwide ,1996," Perhaps one aspect of our company that separates us from other technology companies on the prairie is the scope of our international presence. Our solutions are used on more than 1,250 systems by more than 550 customers in 65 countries on six continents. This year 56 percent of our revenues came from outside the United States. While our U.S. revenues grew at a healthy 23 percent, our revenues in the Europe, Middle East, Africa region and the Asia Pacific region were up 50 and 88 percent, respectively. "
Doc14,ACI Worldwide ,1996," Because ours is an international business, we thought you might be interested in a world tour with stops in a few of our key markets. On the tour we will introduce you to the company, some of our leading customers and certain trends that are influencing our business around the globe. I will be the host for this tour. This explains the clothes I am wearing in the picture. The investor relations officer who insisted I wear them is now serving a special assignment. "
Doc15,ACI Worldwide ,1998,"I can hear the reaction? ??How can 16 billion of anything represent a start? After all, tallying just one billion of something is a huge accomplishment.?? OK, I admit that??s a valid point, but when your business is selling software that processes electronic transactions, you view 16 billion a little differently. Last year, TSA customers processed 16 billion transactions? the largest number yet, but just two percent of the estimated number of transactions generated around the world. That??s why at TSA, we think of 16 billion transactions as ??a start.?? "
Doc16,ACI Worldwide ,1998," Granted, it??s a good start. We??ve been in this business for more than 20 years and have a portfolio of applications that process smart card, debit card, credit card and loyalty card transactions from ATMs (Automated Teller Machines), POS (Pointof- Sale) devices, PCs (Personal Computers), the Internet, and a host of others. Our software is used in 70 countries by banks, retailers, stock exchanges and other enterprises needing high-volume, reliable processing seven days a week, 24 hours a day. "
Doc17,ACI Worldwide ,1998," TSA software is designed to help our more than 2,000 customers take advantage of the ongoing shift in payments from paper to pulse. This movement, fueled by the younger generation??s acceptance of electronic payments (for those of you scoring at home, my mom still won??t use an ATM, while my sons understand all too well how they work), continues to drive the growth in transaction volumes and the need for around-the-clock services?making our products even more attractive. "
Doc18,ACI Worldwide ,1998," During the past year we built on our solid history of strong financials by reaching a number of milestones. TSA achieved records in key financial metrics including record revenues of $289.8 million, record operating income of $51.0 million, and record backlog of $185.2 million. "
Doc19,ACI Worldwide ,1998," Our geographic diversity enabled TSA to ride out the recent difficult economic situations in various areas of the world. In fiscal year 1998, 54 percent of our revenues came from outside the United States. Our Americas revenues grew 20 percent, while our revenues in the Europe/Middle East/Africa region and the Asia/Pacific region were up 35 and 1 percent, respectively. "
Doc20,ACI Worldwide ,1998," In addition to our financial achievements, we completed several acquisitions to complement our product and service offerings. TSA acquired IntraNet to add to our corporate banking product expertise; SCIL and MINT to give us additional strength in the smart card product and integration arena; PRI to complement our information systems consulting offerings; and Edgeware to provide us with additional products for retailers. "
Doc21,ACI Worldwide ,1998, At TSA we believe our business of supplying software for electronic payments is just starting?that it is a business with significant growth opportunities all around the world. We also believe we are strategically positioned to take advantage of those opportunities. 
Doc22,ACI Worldwide ,1999,"Fellow Shareholders: No, that is not me on the cover of this year??s annual report. My photo is on the left. (I??m the tall guy with the full head of hair.) But the follicle-challenged gentleman gracing our cover raises an interesting point. Depending on our situation (and hairline) we all value different things at different times. As we begin our 25th year in business, we felt it appropriate to reflect on the things we value, and as we always do, to have a little fun. "
Doc23,ACI Worldwide ,1999," At TSA we value the expertise and good fortune that??s helped us become a leading provider of enterprise e-payment solutions. The explosion of Internet banking and e-commerce, the proliferation of debit cards, and the continued growth of e-payments are fueling a need for reliable, always available processing systems-just the products we??ve been providing for 25 years. "
Doc24,ACI Worldwide ,1999," More than 2,300 financial institutions, retailers, processors and telcos around the world use our solutions to smoothly and efficiently move money and information. In the past year TSA customers processed an estimated 18 billion electronic transactions, a small percentage of the world??s total volume when you factor in cash and checks, but a portion that is growing faster than paper-based transactions. The younger generation??s acceptance of technology is helping promote this shift from paper to pulse. Rising electronic transaction volumes coupled with the need for around-the-clock services, will make our products even more attractive. Since we base our pricing on transaction volumes, rising volumes enhance our business model. "
Doc25,ACI Worldwide ,1999," Our efforts to expand TSA??s footprint in international markets during the past fiscal year increased the number of countries in which we have customers by nine, bringing our total to 79. Our solutions attracted 241 new customers, including Deutsche Bank, currently the largest bank in the world by assets. Revenue for our 1999 fiscal year increased 19 percent to a record $354.8 million, including $125.5 million in recurring revenue from monthly license fees, maintenance fees and facility management. We posted record operating income of $70.3 million and a record backlog of contracted but not yet recognized business of $203.8 million. TSA acquired SDM International, Inc. and Insession, Inc. to expand our solution and platform set. We introduced a new line of Internet-based e-commerce solutions. Not bad for a year that some thought signaled the end of the world. "
Doc26,ACI Worldwide ,1999," As the fog of Y2K clouded the marketplace, we continued to focus on what we do best, provide solutions that help the world move money and information. Now as our customers concentrate on enhancing their systems, TSA is positioned to help. We??re working with customers to make our products and services-our Transaction SmoothwareTM-the industry standard. To us, Transaction Smoothware is more than a trademark. It is the way we work, our commitment to meet customers?? needs on time, on budget, with no surprises. We believe Transaction Smoothware will become the dominant infrastructure behind e-payments around the world. "
Doc27,ACI Worldwide ,1999," TSA??s aggressive investment in the Internet is providing the technology our customers need to support the next generation of payments. What do we value? At TSA we value the trust our customers have placed in our ability to provide proven solutions. We value our employees who help keep us in the ??right place at the right time.?? We value the growing e-payments market that complements our volume-sensitive pricing. And ultimately, we value the continued support and interest of our shareholders. "
Doc28,ACI Worldwide ,1999," If I might interject a personal note, I value the experiences-both good and sometimes difficult-I??ve had while serving as TSA??s chairman, president and CEO. It has been quite a ride. I also value my family. In order to spend more time with them, this annual report marks my last as president and CEO. While I remain as chairman of the board, I??ve turned over day-to-day duties to Dave Russell, a man whose leadership and talent I respect. Dave most recently served as chief operating officer and executive vice president of TSA, and president of our ACI Worldwide distribution channel. He brings more than 11 years of company experience to his new position as president and CEO, and I know he will do a great job. "
Doc29,ACI Worldwide ,2000,"So how was your year? A look at the numbers indicates fiscal year 2000 will not go down in the record books as TSA??s best. Revenue declined?not because of a new competitor or technology, but because of an event that will never occur again. Y2K. Our customers upgraded their processing infrastructures in advance of the Y2K event, then locked down their systems to ride out the transition.The lock-down dammed up our revenue stream and led to a tough year. "
Doc30,ACI Worldwide ,2000," A look behind the numbers paints a different picture.TSA customers sailed through the Y2K event with flying colors. Unlike the dire predictions of Y2K doomsayers, at 12:01 a.m. January 1  in every time zone around the globe   e-payments kept moving through our customers?? systems, ATMs continued to dispense cash, and consumers were able to use their plastic to purchase everything from a bottle of soda to glitzy Year 2000 mementos. "
Doc31,ACI Worldwide ,2000," As the fireworks faded and the world went back to work, we discovered that, like the house painter who had a banner year leading up to his small town??s centennial celebration, many of our customers enhanced their systems in advance of the big event and didn??t require our help in the months immediately following. "
Doc32,ACI Worldwide ,2000," As all great organizations do during difficult times, we turned the situation to our advantage. We took a step back to make sure TSA was still as we like to say in the right place at the right time.We examined both our technology and our organization, and we refined our choice of areas in which to focus our energies for the future.We also took stock of our unique assets. "
Doc33,ACI Worldwide ,2000," For example,TSA didn??t lose one customer to the Y2K event, and we continue to maintain a world-class customer list of leading financial institutions, retailers and e-payment processing companies. Our core e-payment technologies are second to none. No one offers the broad array of consumer e-payment solutions we do in as many countries as we do. TSA??s business model (based on volume-sensitive pricing, recurring license fees and backlog) allows us to take advantage of the accelerating shift from paper-based transactions to electronic-based. As a result, we believe no other solutions provider is in our position to benefit from the ongoing growth in consumer e-payments. "
Doc34,ACI Worldwide ,2000," TSA technology forms the infrastructure that manages high-volume consumer e-payments where they occur today, and we??re increasingly involved in supporting the e-payments of tomorrow.We??re focusing our investment and development on all consumer e-payments, from traditional debit and credit card systems for which we are known, to emerging e-commerce, wireless and mobile commerce (m-commerce), and Internet e-payment systems. "
Doc35,ACI Worldwide ,2000," TRADITIONAL CONSUMER E-PAYMENTS This is the consumer e-payments environment where transactions are today, and it??s where TSA is the clear market leader. Our proven, 24/7 software powers some of the largest e-payment networks in the world, making it possible for banks and retailers to offer roundthe- clock financial services. These are the systems that enable travelers to withdraw money from an ATM halfway around the world and that allow shoppers to pay for groceries with the swipe of a credit or debit card. "
Doc36,ACI Worldwide ,2000," In spite of all the excitement surrounding the Web and e-commerce, traditional debit and credit card use still makes up more than 90 percent of consumer e-payments. And transaction volumes generated by these traditional consumer payments continue to grow. As volumes increase,TSA??s robust, scalable systems become even more valuable to existing customers and an attractive option to other organizations looking for a proven way to manage consumer e-payments. "
Doc37,ACI Worldwide ,2000," Emerging consumer e-payments e-commerce, wireless and m-commerce still require authorization, settlement and exception management systems to complete transactions.These essential systems are the very ones used today by more than 2,400 TSA customers in 79 countries. "
Doc38,ACI Worldwide ,2000," A quarter century ago, the idea that consumers could access their money from an ATM anywhere in the world or purchase a new pair of shoes by electronically debiting their bank account was considered the stuff of science fiction.Today, TSA makes these consumer e-payments possible and a reliable part of everyday life. "
Doc39,ACI Worldwide ,2000," EMERGING CONSUMER E-PAYMENTS The Internet, wireless networks and other emerging technologies are changing the way we bank, pay bills, shop and manage our finances. "
Doc40,ACI Worldwide ,2000," Even though the numbers of these new transactions are relatively low, they??re expected to grow at a much faster rate than traditional consumer e-payments.We??re investing in and deploying new technologies to help our customers manage these emerging e-payments and extend their infrastructures to the virtual world. "
Doc41,ACI Worldwide ,2000," Our investment includes the acquisition of MessagingDirect Ltd., a Canadian-based company with roots in the secure document delivery space.We plan to use this technology in the rapidly emerging market for electronic statement presentation and electronic bill presentment and payment.We plan to marry this new technology with TSA??s best-of-breed e-payments solutions to help our customers use secure email to deliver statements and bills to consumers and get them paid.We??re extremely excited about this initiative, and our research indicates this could indeed be a ??killer app.?? The solution will save our customers money, offer them unique marketing opportunities and is ideal for a market with an incredible level of paper-based transactions to streamline. Right up our alley. Early market feedback from our customers is extremely positive. "
Doc42,ACI Worldwide ,2000," Additionally, we??re launching new e-commerce products designed to help retailers and financial institutions manage other virtual e-payments. These new solutions include a Personal Online Data (POD) e-wallet that earned TSA a ??best of show?? award at IDG World Expo??s Internet Commerce Expo (ICe) 2000. POD can be used with a variety of devices including PCs, wireless devices and digital televisions. It also helps to eliminate the cumbersome process of filling out online forms that can discourage consumers from shopping online. "
Doc43,ACI Worldwide ,2000," Around the world,TSA solutions are providing a ??payments portal?? that integrates wireless devices, the Internet and existing payments networks. Our solutions are always on just like the virtual world and offer cutting-edge security, convenience and performance. "
Doc44,ACI Worldwide ,2000, FUTURE CONSUMER E-PAYMENTS These are but a few examples of where our consumer e-payments technology fits today and where we are taking it. For more than 25 years we??ve been a leader in consumer e-payments from creation of one of the world??s first ATM networks to enabling today??s wireless and m-commerce services and we??re investing in a strategy to ensure we retain our leadership position. 
Doc45,ACI Worldwide ,2000," There are early signs that our strategy to focus on consumer e-payments is working. We believe our Q4 2000 revenue shows momentum is returning to our business. Q4 revenue in Europe was at a record level as early adopters embraced our new technology. As these new e-payment technologies spread around the globe, our pioneering work will give us the expertise and proven products to help other customers. "
Doc46,ACI Worldwide ,2000, We??re excited about the direction we??re taking the company and believe it is the right strategy to keep TSA at the forefront of the consumer e-payments market. 
Doc47,ACI Worldwide ,2000," TSA SOLUTIONS MANAGE WEB-BASED AND WIRELESS E-PAYMENTS DEUTSCHE BANK ITALY, one of the largest online merchant processors in Italy, licensed TSA e-commerce solutions to provide secure e-payment processing services. "
Doc48,ACI Worldwide ,2000, NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE uses TSA technology to offer consumers the ability to check their account balances via cell phone. Our software enables the bank to provide a variety of wireless services  including a messaging feature that notifies consumers when an important check has cleared or a deposit is credited. 
Doc49,ACI Worldwide ,2000," In Australia, TSA solutions make it possible for TELSTRA WIRELESS telephone customers to recharge their wireless phone service at an ATM. Instead of having to search out a service center, consumers can conveniently recharge their wireless service while on the go. "
Doc50,ACI Worldwide ,2000," From its base in Spain, MOVILPAY is using TSA technology to build an m-commerce system that will allow consumers to use their mobile telephones to pay for items at shops, vending machines, or on the Internet. MovilPay plans to roll out its innovative system to consumers in more than 30 countries around the world, each time using TSA software as the foundation. "
Doc51,ACI Worldwide ,2000," We??ve announced the corporate strategy to divest products and business units that do not fall within the consumer e-payments arena and are actively investing time, money and people in projects that extend our solutions to the Web and wireless environments. "
Doc52,ACI Worldwide ,2000, We??re leveraging our worldwide distribution network and employee expertise to provide the e-payment technology our customers need to do business in their corner of the globe and wherever they may reach. 
Doc53,ACI Worldwide ,2000," We're helping our customers manage consumer e-payments where they are now, and working to make sure we can help customers handle transactions wherever they may be tomorrow. "
Doc54,ACI Worldwide ,2000," We??re continuing to build solutions designed for consumers who expect always-available, convenient access to their money and shopping. "
Doc55,ACI Worldwide ,2000, We??re positioning TSA to take full advantage of the inevitable shift from paper to pulse. 
Doc56,ACI Worldwide ,2001,"As the saying goes, May you live in interesting times. Fiscal year 2001 was nothing if not interesting. When the year began, the dot.com bubble burst, and as the year ended, we found ourselves in a tense geopolitical environment after the events of September 11. Within our corner of the world, pressure on information technology spending caused many technology providers to reassess where they were and where they were heading. The world changed, and the road to success became more challenging to navigate. "
Doc57,ACI Worldwide ,2001," TSA also changed substantially in 2001. After examining our market position and our future prospects, we made fairly dramatic changes to our structure and our team. While we continued to enjoy a position as the leading global provider of electronic payment software, we reassessed where we were spending our money and how we were focused to not only retain our position, but strengthen it over time. It became clear that if we focused on the right initiatives, from R&D to sales and marketing, we had an opportunity to emerge from these chaotic times even stronger than before. History has shown that enduring companies are those with proven products and customers, a clear business plan, and the ability to adapt to change. "
Doc58,ACI Worldwide ,2001," We addressed our cost structure. We reduced our investments in solutions that, while promising and at times leading-edge, did not appear likely to pay off in the near to medium term. Our resulting cost structure and balance sheet put us in a better position to succeed. We ended the year with our lowest expense run rate in several years and had $32 million in cash. Our platform is sound and ready to be leveraged as global IT expenditures rebound. "
Doc59,ACI Worldwide ,2001," We addressed our research and development strategy, ensuring that our resources were applied to the right initiatives with a high level of focus and energy. We concentrated on initiatives that we believe will not only improve our competitive position, but also extend us into new markets. "
Doc60,ACI Worldwide ,2001," We reinforced our sales and marketing efforts, ensuring that our key messages were getting to market and that we were properly leveraging our global sales and delivery channels. The markets are proving to be receptive to our expanded solutions message, something we call the ACI Commerce Framework, essentially an integrated solution set for the complete range of needs along the e-commerce value chain. This is something no other software company can provide, and it??s a key component of an enduring, winning strategy for TSA. "
Doc61,ACI Worldwide ,2001," Industry reports show that people around the world continue to increase their use of electronic payment technologies, from traditional magnetic stripe credit and debit cards, to the rapidly increasing use of smart cards and mobile phones. TSA has products deployed today that address these needs ? not yet the true high-volume transaction drivers, but certainly the drivers of the future. Important new solutions will create new growth opportunities for TSA in e-commerce, mobile commerce, e-fraud management, smart cards, enterprise-wide payments authorization and secure document delivery and payment. "
Doc62,ACI Worldwide ,2001," TSA has over 2,300 customers in 81 countries. We continue to expand our market share, adding more than 170 new customers in fiscal 2001. Our software is deployed in the highest volume, most demanding e-payment systems in the world. We have competitive solutions for both traditional and emerging e-payment technologies, with more in the R&D stages. We have a new relationship with IBM that we expect will help us penetrate new markets where we have only just scratched the surface. Our new e-Courier solution for electronic document delivery and payment, obtained through the acquisition of MessagingDirect, Ltd., is gaining traction in the market and is a product applicable to multiple industries and uses. "
Doc63,ACI Worldwide ,2001," Perhaps most important, our employees continue to exhibit the expertise, motivation and staying power to secure our position well into the future. Our vision for an integrated e-payments architecture is clear and is aggressively being taken to market. Our broadened solutions focus is clearly differentiated from our competition. Our customers are growing their e-payment transaction volumes and seeking to work with us on new, innovative technologies. We continue to get feedback that the robust, high-quality nature of our software helps customers successfully manage their business. "
Doc64,ACI Worldwide ,2001," As an aside, we would like to thank Bill Fisher and Dave Russell for their dedication and commitment to the company over the years, and we wish them well in their new endeavors. The company has emerged from trying times more efficient and stronger than before. We appreciate the efforts of our global employee base and expect even greater things from them in the future. We thank you as shareholders for your support and interest in TSA. "
Doc65,ACI Worldwide ,2002,"Fiscal 2002 was a challenging year for TSA. The economy remained slow, and in the information technology industry where we compete, the environment was especially difficult. "
Doc66,ACI Worldwide ,2002," It was during this period that we both had the opportunity to join the company. With the help of TSA senior management, we made difficult decisions needed to help the company weather a tough business environment. Then as our business began to improve, we were forced to take on an unexpected challenge. In August, we initiated a re-audit of fiscal years 2000, 2001 and the first three quarters of the fiscal year 2002. The re-audit was prompted by an internal review of our business dealings with a former customer, the resulting determination that a restatement was required, and a prior change of our external auditors. It was a difficult but necessary process. As a result, we have changed our accounting policies relating to revenue recognition and filed restated financials for prior periods. "
Doc67,ACI Worldwide ,2002," Throughout the re-audit process, our employees maintained their focus on our day-to-day business and customers. We continued to deliver the robust solutions that financial institutions, retailers and payment processors require to handle their complex transaction processing needs. And, we leveraged our 27-year history, experienced staff, proven products and management depth to maintain our leadership position in providing e-payment solutions. "
Doc68,ACI Worldwide ,2002," During fiscal 2002 we: Consolidated key research and development and customer support functions to enhance economies of scale. Sold our Regency Systems business, which focused on the U.S. community banking market and was no longer strategic to TSA??s operations. Invested in open systems with BASE24-es?? and other products such as ACI Proactive Risk Manager?? to position us for future growth. "
Doc69,ACI Worldwide ,2002, These were some of the key decisions designed to help TSA maintain its leadership position in the e-payment solutions market. 
Doc70,ACI Worldwide ,2002," TSA serves the needs of large financial institutions, retailers and payment processors and maintains a market share that is considerably greater than our nearest e-payment software competitor. Our products address a steady move toward electronic payments in many forms, with a heritage founded on delivering robust solutions characterized by high levels of scale and reliability. "
Doc71,ACI Worldwide ,2002, We are indeed important to our customers as they depend on our e-payment solutions every second of every day. Our decades of experience has given us an in-depth understanding of complex transaction processing needs. 
Doc72,ACI Worldwide ,2002," As technology changes, so do we. We are immersed in initiatives with our customers and partners in emerging e-payment channels and technologies like the Internet, and smart cards. And while traditional delivery channels such as the ATM and the physical point of sale drive substantially more transactions and revenue for TSA than do the emerging channels, we believe we are well positioned as these newer technologies begin to gain market adoption. "
Doc73,ACI Worldwide ,2002," The technology on which we deliver our e-payment solutions has changed as well. The company now offers its market-leading e-payment solutions on open-systems technology, giving us the flexibility to offer our products in the fashion and on the platforms our customers want. Our BASE24-es and Money Transfer System?? (MTS??) solutions offer our customers leadership in scale and reliability, and are now available on industry-standard technology. We believe no other e-payment software provider can offer the breadth of solutions we do on as many platforms. "
Doc74,ACI Worldwide ,2002, The financial payment industry is constantly changing and is characterized by a steady shift toward people and companies conducting more of their financial affairs electronically. We believe this trend provides a solid base for our continued success. 
Doc75,ACI Worldwide ,2002," We??ve gone through a number of changes during the past year ? changes in leadership, a consolidation of internal functions, a divestiture of a business that was no longer strategic, and an investment in open-systems products. We will be making enhancements to our policies and procedures as a result of our completed re-audit. What we haven??t changed is our long-term commitment to our customers and our desire to provide the leading e-payment software in the market. "
Doc76,ACI Worldwide ,2003,"In what proved to be another challenging year for the global business environment, TSA made significant progress in a number of key areas. Financially, our earnings were $.40 per diluted share on revenues of $277 million. Results for the year included a $9.3 million non-deductible goodwill impairment charge as well as $2.0 million in restructuring charges associated with staff reductions. Our cash flow continued to be strong and we finished the year with a strengthened balance sheet. We increased our cash position from $87.9 million to $114.0 million and we continue to operate with little long-term debt. Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities improved to 1.71 to 1. "
Doc77,ACI Worldwide ,2003," We strengthened our executive management team and added two new independent board members. We realigned our staffing levels, giving us a more efficient operating structure going forward. As we made these financial and operational improvements throughout fiscal 2003, the market in turn validated our progress with an increase in market capitalization. "
Doc78,ACI Worldwide ,2003," We also made significant progress in reshaping our products for the future. Within ACI, TSA??s largest business unit, the company??s flagship BASE24?? software was essentially reinvented in the form of the re-engineered BASE24-es??. The new software inherits many of the industry-leading attributes of BASE24. BASE24-es is built for reliable, 24/7 processing of all types of electronic payment transactions and can scale to accommodate the performance demands of the world??s largest and most sophisticated e-payment processors. But while BASE24 was available on a single computing platform, BASE24-es can operate on a full range of industry-standard platforms offered by HP, IBM and Sun Microsystems. It takes advantage of the latest in software engineering techniques to yield a system that is more cost efficient for customers to operate and for ACI to maintain. "
Doc79,ACI Worldwide ,2003, IntraNet made a similar transformation in 2003. The company consolidated its market leadership position in the U.S. by migrating nearly all of its customers to the new open systems version of their Money Transfer System?? (MTS??). This gives IntraNet a platform from which to extend its U.S. market-leading solution for money transfer and global messaging into targeted regions. 
Doc80,ACI Worldwide ,2003," The theme was the same at Insession Technologies. The company??s strategy is built around providing infrastructure software for heterogeneous computing environments on multiple platforms. To that end, Insession invested in more ??open?? capabilities in 2003, enabling its flagship ICE product to compete in a multi-platform world and forging new partnerships to act as the distributor of other open systems solutions.

Doc81,ACI Worldwide ,2003," The principle of reinvention holds that a market leader must continually invest to rise above the competition.

Doc83,Adobe ,1996,"For Adobe, 1996 was a year of building toward future growth in a rapidly changing industry. We are pleased to have put in place new market initiatives, technology directions, and organizational changes that position us to take full advantage of long-term opportunities, while achieving solid financial results. In 1996, revenue reached $786.6 million, and reported net income totaled $153.3 million, or $2.04 per share, compared with 1995 revenue of $762.3 million, net income of $93.5 million, and earnings per share of $1.26. These figures resulted both from normal recurring operations and from substantial returns on the company's venture investment program. Normalized net income for 1996-excluding expenses from divested or discontinued businesses and net gains from external investments-totaled $128.2 million, compared with $135.6 million in 1995, while earnings per share were $1.71, compared with $1.80. "
Doc84,Adobe ,1996," During 1996, the company declared cash dividends on its common stock totaling $0,20 per share. We repurchased 3.3 million shares of common stock during the year, offsetting dilution from expected issuances under our employee stock plans. At year end, the number of outstanding shares of common stock totaled 71.5 million. Our financial position remains strong, with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances of $564.1 million. "
Doc85,Adobe ,1996," Adobe's investment program, which includes Adobe Ventures L.P., direct investments, and other activities, annually introduces us to hundreds of innovative companies that are strategic to our software business. The program gives us a window on emerging technologies and markets, and funds companies that make a broader set of products and services available to our customers. Now three years old, the venture investment program generated significant returns in 1996, primarily because several companies in our portfolio-most notably Netscape Communications-made public stock offerings. The returns from these activities are funding internal development programs, further external investments, and other corporate initiatives. "
Doc86,Adobe ,1996," Revenue from the licensing of Adobe PostScript and other printing technologies reached $196.7 million, compared with the $183.4 million posted in 1995. This growth reflects increased shipments of color printers, Japanese printers, and implementations of the Configurable PostScript Interpreter (CPSI).

Doc92,Adobe ,1996," At Adobe, we are committed to offering cross-platform implementations of our application products, giving users maximum choice and compatibility. Today we are capitalizing quickly on new opportunities in the Windows market. Having already incorporated full Windows 95 support into our applications, we now are collaborating with hardware manufacturers and other third parties to deliver powerful, creative capabilities to users of the Windows NT operating system. Adobe products such as Photoshop and PhotoDeluxe, for example, are among the first to support the Intel MMX processor, which optimizes image-handling speeds. New versions of Adobe FrameMaker and Adobe PageMaker include support for symmetric multiprocessing computers and other performance-enhancing features. Additional Windows NT product upgrades are scheduled to enter the market in 1997, aided by worldwide advertising and promotional campaigns. "

Adobe??s overall financial position is strong, with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances of $503 million and no long-term debt, as of our fiscal year-end on November 28,1997 "
Doc102,Adobe ,1997," In 1997, Adobe??s relationship with our key customer base, professional designers, remained strong, while a new class of users increasingly turned to our applications for the power to make ideas compelling. Customer research indicates that the number of corporate users of Adobe graphics applications is increasing impressively The result was outstanding sales. Application products revenue climbed 21 percent in 1997. "
Doc103,Adobe ,1997," The growth of the Web fueled revenue from Adobe graphics applications. indeed, as Adobe continues to integrate and expand the Web capabilities of our product line. customers increasingly use our tools to create graphics and deliver documents for the Internet. "
Doc104,Adobe ,1997," Adobe has continued to attract customers by tightly integrating its graphics products into a virtual suite. For example, we??ve added consistent features, user interfaces, and functionality to Adobe?? Photoshop Adobe Illustrator.?? and Adobe PageMaker?? to form an online and print publishing solution that competitors with only a single product offering simply cannot match. "
Doc105,Adobe ,1997," Particularly notable was Adobe??s growth on the Windows platform. In 1996. Adobe made simultaneous cross-platform product releases a priority in 1997, for the first time, revenue from Windows platform products exceeded that from the Macintosh platform. Windows products accounted for 51 percent of application products revenue (excluding platform-independent and UNIX products), with 49 percent going to Macintosh products. On a year-over-year basis, application products revenue on the Windows platform grew 64 percent. "
Doc106,Adobe ,1997, Shipments of Adobe illustrator 7.0 in 1997 demonstrate the company??s success in making graphics a priority for Windows users.

With AdobeAcrobat, we didn't have to reauthor materials to get them readyfor the Web. says Rich Pavlovslty, JPL Webmaster "
Doc108,Adobe ,1997," Our printing business faces challenges and opportunlties. The past year was challenging for our printing technologies, the primary source of our licensing revenue. We launched Adobe PostScript 3,?? the next generation of the world-standard printing technology primed to meet the needs of Internet-based, distributed printing environments. With IBM, we announced the first on-demand digital printing system based on Adobe PostScript Extreme the lBM InfoPrint 4000, which prints at speeds exceeding 1,000 pages per minute. And products based on Adobe PrintGear the architecture that dramatically improves the quality and performance of low-cost printers for small offices, home offices, and workgroups continue to garner awards and acclaim. "
Doc109,Adobe ,1997," Despite these accomplishments, revenue from the licensing of Adobe PostScript and other printing technologies reached $196 million, effectively level with $197 million in 1996. The year-to-year flatness is the result of a number of factors affecting our original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers, primarily in the Japanese and Macintosh markets. We continue to evaluate ways to better communicate the value of Adobe PostScript and serve our customers?? needs in a distribute-then-print world. "
Doc110,Adobe ,1997," Adobe makes digltal workflows a reality for enterprises. In 1997, Adobe led the industry in enabling digital workflows, a revolutionary trend that we expect to accelerate in the coming year. Digital workflow a streamlined publishing process, independent of hardware, computing platforms, and applications lets businesses create compelling content once and then easily publish both in print and on the Web, instead of duplicating efforts and reauthoring using separate, expensive systems for different media, thus saving time and money. "
Doc111,Adobe ,1997," Adobe solutions are the foundation for an efficient digital workflow. Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), for example, is increasingly being adopted worldwide as a de facto standard format for Internet document publishing. The number of copies of free Adobe Acrobat Reader software Adobe has distributed shot past the 20 million mark in 1997. PDF generation is integrated into many Adobe authoring applications such as Adobe Illustrator 7.0, Adobe Photoshop 4.0, and Adobe PageMaker 6.5. "

In late 1997, we adapted our organization to reflect our commitment to new markets To streamline planning and decision making, we now share the new Office of the Chairman of the Board. We restructured Adobes business units to focus on growing market opportunities. In addition to our Priming and Systems Division and our Graphics Products Division, we established an Enterprise Solutions Division. We also created a Home and Office Products Division to address the needs of homes and small businesses. Finally, we created an Engineering Technology Group, which will carry on Adobes tradition of developing innovative technologies and driving standards All divisions are dedicated to delivering new high-quality solutions as well as new versions of key products in 1998.

"
Doc124,Adobe ,1998," The overall revenue decline from the previous fiscal year was due in large part to the instability of the Asian market and decreased licensing revenue. In particular, revenue from Japan declined 28% from $204 million in 1997 to 148 million in 1998, The decision by Hewlett-Packard to remove Adobe PostScript software from its monochrome printing devices has had continuing repercussions. Licensing revenue is likely to decline in fiscal 19991 We see growth opportunities for licensing revenue in the long term as both color printing and digital copiers become more pervasive. Product development and marketing efforts with strategic customers such as Xerox, EFI, and Tektronix promise to help us capitalize on these trends. New challenges in the first part ofthe year helped us learn some important lessons about leadership. ln August 1998, we implemented a restructuring plan that streamlined our organization and made possible far more effective decision making. The resulting lowered cost structure formed the foundation for a leaner, more efficient organization, and we realized immediate benefits with a favorable fourth quarter. "

Adobe InDesign was a strong performer from day one. The InDesign Jump Start program helped ease the transition for large-scale publishing enterprises making a switch from other publishing technologies, and we provided equally comprehensive support to new adopters in smaller design and publishing environments. After only six months on the market, InDesign boasted several key wins. DDB Needham, McCann-Erickson, Young & Rubicam, and CAPPS Digital have adopted InDesign to streamline page layout. The robustness and extensibility of InDesign coupled with our customers?? frustration at the lack of software alternatives promise to help us secure a foothold in this $500-million-per-year market. "

In March 1999, publishing industry guru Andrew Tribute called this desktop proofing software ??a facilitator of change . . . that can cause a fundamental switch in the market.?? And the integration of Adobe PostScript?? Extreme?? technology into high-end print systems around the globe demonstrates that we continue to drive important trends in the printing industry from the ground up. "
Doc146,Adobe ,1999," When it comes to the enterprise, Adobe??s influence has never been stronger. In April, we shipped Adobe Acrobat 4.0, a powerful, updated version of the industry-standard document exchange software. Built on feedback from our customers, the new version incorporates extensive workgroup collaboration tools and support for digital signatures. By fiscal year-end, Acrobat revenue had passed the $100 million mark, more than doubling the previous year??s revenue and firmly reiterating our leadership position. In June, we introduced Adobe ePaper Solutions. Combining a variety of Acrobat and Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) technologies, Adobe ePaper Solutions make it easier than ever for government agencies and businesses in document-intensive markets including financial services, legal, insurance, and pharmaceuticals to jointly manage their electronic and paper-based information workflows. "
Doc147,Adobe ,1999," As Adobe crosses the threshold of a new millennium, there??s much to be excited about. With the continuing evolution of the World Wide Web, we will have many opportunities to set new standards. Both large and small Web-bound companies now have access to the same kinds of eCommerce servers, routers, and other back-end technologies for true 24/7 operations. The key point of differentiation at this juncture is how companies in this fiercely competitive environment brand themselves. From maintaining a visually rich Web site to displaying goods and services with compelling fidelity, successful online retailers will capture their customers much as they have in the traditional retail world. And they??ll do it with Adobe software. From the powerful Adobe design and production applications available today to future technologies based on standards such as eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), online retailers will have access to some of the most innovative, creative tools ever created. With each of these solutions, Adobe is committed to leading the eMerchandising market just as we have led our traditional markets in the past. "
Doc148,Adobe ,1999," As we look ahead, we anticipate capturing a significant share of the professional publishing software market as Adobe InDesign becomes a solution of choice for graphic designers, agencies, and service bureaus. Speaking of solutions, we will continue to offer the well-received Adobe Collections. These powerful suites bring together three or more Adobe applications at a significant price break for professionals working on the Web, in print, in business publishing environments, or with digital video. As more enterprises learn to manage their electronic and paper information assets in a fluid, heterogeneous environment, Adobe ePaper Solutions will help them achieve their goals. The competitive prices and consumer-level availability of digital video hardware provide an opportunity for us to address the needs of all levels of users, just as we have done with our digital imaging franchise. And the electronic distribution of all manner of published content allows us to bring our expertise from the print world to the digital domain. From eBooks to digital rights management, you??ll see Adobe providing the enabling technologies that make it possible to distribute and obtain information in truly revolutionary ways. "
Doc149,Adobe ,1999," In closing, we realize that a turnaround of the magnitude Adobe has seen this year is directly attributable to the hard work, dedication, and vision of our employees. We??ve known that our people are our greatest asset since long before it became fashionable to say so, and we are committed to retaining a talented workforce and hiring the very best as we continue to grow. With their help, Adobe will continue to create, market, and support the software that helps people in all professions make inspiration become reality. "
Doc150,Adobe ,2000,"It??s hard to believe that it has been only ten years since Adobe Photoshop changed the way graphic designers work with images destined for the printed page. At that time, we couldn??t have guessed the extent of its influence. During the past decade, Adobe has distributed more than 30 million units of products based on Photoshop software, and Photoshop technology has transformed the way information is presented on the World Wide Web. Today, with a full suite of equally powerful applications, Adobe Systems has become a recognized leader in the creation, management, and delivery of rich Web content seen by millions of people worldwide. And more than 200 million copies of Acrobat Reader software have been distributed worldwide, making Adobe a global household name. As we continue to help people communicate through the creation of visually rich information, we are pursuing the many opportunities afforded by the next generation of Internet-enabled innovations, including broadband, wireless, and Internet appliance technologies. In fiscal 2000, these pursuits translated into a record year for Adobe Systems. Our diluted earnings per share increased by 23%, from $0.92 to $1.13 year over year, and our operating profit increased by 57% year over year. We achieved seven consecutive quarters of sequential revenue growth and six consecutive quarters of record revenue. Led by a highly focused management team, we executed on our existing business plan and began to set the stage for Network Publishing, a visionary Internet-centric publishing model in which all types of digital content can be published and viewed by anyone, anywhere, on any device. "
Doc151,Adobe ,2000," As Adobe Systems continues to develop inspiring software, to catalyze innovative new markets, and to provide leadership for the Network Publishing community, we??re operating from an unprecedented position of strength. And although we will never stop refining our operational controls, our newest phase of growth relies directly upon our growing software application revenue. Simply put, we??re ready  financially, strategically, and creatively  for What??s Next. "
Doc152,Adobe ,2000," RECORD NUMBERS BECOME REALITY In fiscal 2000, Adobe exceeded its internal annual revenue budget, and for the second consecutive year, revenue exceeded $1 billion, reaching a new high of $1.266 billion. This represents a 25% increase compared with fiscal 1999. Reported net income reached a record level of $288 million, a 21% increase compared with fiscal 1999. "
Doc153,Adobe ,2000," Adobe??s Web Publishing revenue grew to $536.6 million, a 36% increase over fiscal 1999. Cross-media Publishing revenue grew to $390.5 million, a 10% increase. Success of Adobe Acrobat software and related products pushed Adobe ePaper Solutions application revenue from $129.3 million to $207.8 million, an increase of 61% over 1999. And as we projected, revenue from our OEM PostScript and Other segment declined in 2000 from $138.2 million to $131.5 million, which is a drop-off of 5%. The growth and strength in our other market segments more than offset this decline. "
Doc154,Adobe ,2000," OUR LEANEST OPERATIONS EVER Adobe has been improving and refining company-wide operations to produce a lean, efficient organization capable of agile responses in a fast-moving marketplace. Leveraging a state-of-the-art financial system, we are now at the forefront of operational excellence in the industry. Among other achievements, we have streamlined our worldwide accounting process so we can now close two days after the quarter ends. Improvements like this have helped us build a highly predictable business operation that can readily scale as the company grows. "
Doc155,Adobe ,2000," During fiscal 2000, direct costs were reduced, helping to increase gross margins from 90.7% in fiscal 1999 to 93.1% in fiscal 2000. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative overhead was reduced from 10.2% to 9.2%. With carefully managed expenses, operating profit increased to $408.1 million in fiscal 2000. "
Doc156,Adobe ,2000," REVENUE GROWTH THROUGH APPLICATIONS While tight operational controls contributed significantly to our overall fiscal health, our growth was driven primarily by record revenue from our industry-standard applications. Web and print professionals enjoyed new versions of our flagship products. "
Doc157,Adobe ,2000," Both Adobe Photoshop 6.0 and Adobe Illustrator 9.0 software delivered significant enhancements for working with rich Web content. With an expanded feature set and tighter integration with other Adobe applications, Adobe GoLive 5.0 software garnered rave product reviews. And Adobe LiveMotion software gave Web designers an intuitive software tool that integrates with Photoshop and GoLive and produces compelling Web animations in the Macromedia?? Flash?? (SWF) file format. As Web publishers compete for attention online, they are beginning to integrate rich media and streaming video into their Web sites. In the midst of this trend, Adobe continued to benefit as the leading provider of video-editing tools for broadcast professionals. And with dynamic media products such as Adobe Premiere and Adobe After Effects software, we are taking advantage of all aspects of the current Web media convergence. From site building tools to digital video and imaging software, Adobe empowers Web designers to showcase their products online, build strong Web brands, and make e-commerce a reality. "
Doc158,Adobe ,2000," For cross-media professionals, we continued to deliver layout tools that streamline the management of digital assets between the print and Web worlds. The latest update to Adobe InDesign software addressed many of our customers?? workflow concerns, and we increased our investment in markets where we are working to establish InDesign as the professional layout application of choice. While this market will not grow as rapidly as Web Publishing, it nonetheless represents a $500 million per year opportunity that we continue to pursue. Adobe PageMaker software enjoyed strong success with business professionals, and Adobe FrameMaker?? software continued to be the preferred application for the publication of complex technical documents. Adobe??s solutions for page layout, illustration, business publishing, and printing enable graphic designers, production artists, and prepress professionals to create the visually rich information we see every day on the printed page. "
Doc159,Adobe ,2000," BEYOND THE ENTERPRISE Built on the foundation of Adobe Portable Document Format, Adobe ePaper Solutions continued to bridge the worlds of digital and paper-based information in corporations, government agencies, and other large organizations. And while revenue from Adobe Acrobat set all-time records in 2000, Adobe ePaper Solutions are now reaching far beyond the enterprise. In 2000, Adobe PDF became an important format in the emerging eBook market. In March, Stephen King??s Riding the Bullet became the first book from a major author to be published only in Adobe PDF. And in September, Adobe acquired Glassbook, Inc., further solidifying our position as a leader in this young but extremely promising space. As the eBook market continues to evolve, we plan to offer solutions that allow the easy reading and printing of Adobe PDF  based eBook content from any device. And as the Internet becomes the preferred medium for exchanging information, Adobe ePaper Solutions will continue to provide innovative tools for preserving documents exactly as intended and exchanging them securely with anyone, anywhere. "
Doc160,Adobe ,2000," As we pioneer new markets and help define the future of publishing, we must also remember our roots. PostScript, the page description language that launched Adobe and helped start the Desktop Publishing revolution, is still the technology graphics pros and publishers rely on for quality printing. That??s one of the main reasons the OEM PostScript and Other segment of our business composed 10% of our overall revenue in fiscal 2000. "
Doc161,Adobe ,2000," NETWORK PUBLISHING As the Third Wave of the modern publishing revolution, Network Publishing will enable the streamlined creation, management, and delivery of visual content that can be deployed across any device including Web-enabled wireless phones, Internet appliances, and PDAs. Adobe is leveraging our legacy of leadership, especially our workflow expertise, to make this vision a reality. But we??re not doing it alone. In October 2000, several industry leaders  including Interwoven, Hewlett- Packard, Nokia, RealNetworks, and ATG  announced support for the joint development of complementary technologies that will empower both corporations and individuals to communicate like never before. "
Doc162,Adobe ,2000," Network Publishing promises to be just as important to the coming decade as Desktop Publishing and Web Publishing were to the ??80s and ??90s. The opportunity to change the way technology is developed and deployed, along with holistic employee benefits and a uniquely creative work environment, are just a few of the reasons that hundreds of engineers as well as sales, marketing, finance, and support professionals choose to work at Adobe. In fact, this year Adobe Systems can be found once again in FORTUNE Magazine??s ??100 Best Companies to Work for.?? We are also among the technology leaders committed to making a difference. Through cash grants, employee volunteer support, and nonprofit training, the Adobe Community Relations program makes significant contributions in the areas of K 12 education, fair housing, and other social services. More information on these programs is available at www.adobe.com /aboutadobe/philanthropy. "
Doc163,Adobe ,2000," At Adobe, we consider ourselves to have four primary constituents: our customers, our stockholders, our employees, and our community. By continuing to provide inspiring products, increasing stockholder value, creating an innovative workplace, and investing in community relations, we strive to address each constituent??s needs. We thank you for your part in making Adobe successful. "
Doc164,Adobe ,2001,"During fiscal 2001, Adobe Systems assumed a leadership role in turning the promise of Network Publishing into reality. Working closely with our partners, we delivered powerful software tools that help our customers publish anything, anywhere, on any device. We listened closely to our customers to discover how Network Publishing is unfolding in today??s changing communications environment. We introduced technologies that enable the delivery of highly personalized, visually rich content?and the industry took notice. Communications from both our partners and competitors echoed our vision and are helping to establish Network Publishing as the model for the next wave of publishing. Just as important, Adobe ePaper Solutions made further strides into the enterprise, and Adobe PDF has provided a foundation for streamlined corporate and government electronic document workflows worldwide. "
Doc165,Adobe ,2001," Even with these successes, Adobe Systems, like many technology leaders, experienced a difficult fiscal 2001. Our diluted earnings per share decreased from $1.13 to $0.83 year over year, and our operating profit decreased by 7% year over year. One of the greatest factors contributing to these results was the widespread decision by enterprises to defer capital investments, including software purchases. And creative professionals?our core customers?were hit particularly hard as corporations spent less on marketing and advertising programs. As Adobe tracks these and other trends, we are working toward meeting our customers?? changing needs. "
Doc166,Adobe ,2001," As enterprises and governments worldwide streamlined their processes to more fully leverage their Internet-based infrastructures, we delivered Adobe ePaper Solutions, such as Adobe Acrobat, to drive this evolution from paper-based to digital workflows. In April, we shipped Adobe Acrobat 5.0, which has garnered excellent reviews and impressive revenue. In fact, despite the difficult economic environment, revenue from Acrobat software grew more than 40% over fiscal 2000 and now represents 24% of Adobe??s total revenue. For large organizations implementing Web-based electronic forms solutions, we introduced Adobe Acrobat Approval software. And newly released versions of Acrobat Reader for Palm OS and Pocket PC devices allowed publishers to deliver Adobe PDF files to millions of handheld device users. "
Doc167,Adobe ,2001," Looking at the coming year, we are inspired by the opportunities that lie ahead. As publishers, advertising agencies, and creative professionals adopt Network Publishing workflows, Adobe will provide the tools they need to create, manage, and deliver visually rich communications. Surging sales of digital cameras and digital video recorders are opening a huge opportunity for Adobe??s marketleading imaging software. And the continued streamlining of corporate business processes means an even greater opportunity for Adobe ePaper Solutions, our fastest growing market segment. Leveraging these trends, our strong cash position, and continued operational excellence, we will ensure that Adobe continues to be everywhere our stockholders, partners, and customers look. "
Doc168,Adobe ,2001," In fiscal 2001, Adobe achieved revenue of $1.230 billion. This represents a 3% decrease compared with fiscal 2000. Reported net income reached a level of $205.6 million, a 29% decrease compared with fiscal 2000. Operating profit was $378.5 million in fiscal 2001, a decrease of 7% compared to fiscal 2000. Based on our new operating segments, Adobe??s Graphics revenue was $543.4 million, a 10% decrease from fiscal 2000. Cross-media Publishing revenue was $289.6 million, an 11% decrease. Revenue from our OEM PostScript and Other segment declined in 2001, from $131.5 million to $104.8 million, a drop-off of 20%. And robust licensing of Adobe Acrobat software and related products pushed Adobe ePaper Solutions revenue from $207.6 million to $291.9 million, an increase of 41% over 2000. (For further information on our former and new business segments, please refer to our Form 10-K.) "
Doc169,Adobe ,2001," Despite the difficult economic environment of fiscal 2001, we showed that we can tightly manage our business. We minimized direct costs, resulting in gross margins of 93.4%, compared with 93.1% in fiscal 2000. Additionally, soon after the economy began to affect our business during the year, we swiftly exercised company-wide operational expense reductions, which enabled us to deliver respectable bottom-line results. "
Doc170,Adobe ,2001," Adobe continues to be a highly profitable company, and we are operating from a strong financial position. On a GAAP basis, our operating profit margin was 31% in fiscal 2001. On a pro forma basis, our operating profit margin (which excludes restructuring and other charges, acquired in-process research and development, and amortization of goodwill) was 33%. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $581.6 million as of November 30, 2001. And although we reduced our overall expenses during the year, we continued to increase research and development headcount. In fiscal 2001, Adobe spent nearly a quarter of a billion dollars on R&D. This investment will help position us for long-term growth and success. "
Doc171,Adobe ,2001," While some of Adobe??s competitors focused their efforts on developing either Web- or print-only publishing tools, we believed our customers would want to communicate both onscreen and on the printed page, and we developed our software solutions accordingly. In fiscal 2002, Adobe will continue to deliver cross-media applications that allow publishers to communicate cost-effectively in the medium of their choice. "
Doc172,Adobe ,2001," With the announcement of InDesign 2.0 software, we continued to rally support among professional publishers and designers looking for an alternative publishing application. Adobe PageMaker software continues to provide business users with the tools they need to communicate with impact, and Adobe FrameMaker software remains the application of choice for producers of long, structured documents. Adobe Premiere and Adobe After Effects are becoming increasingly popular, due to exceptional growth in the digital video (DV) market, where Adobe has a strong position in the professional segment. Customers making the switch from analog to digital photography are licensing our new consumer-oriented imaging software, Adobe Photoshop Elements. And for creative professionals working in print and on the Web, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator software continue to set the standard for high-end digital imaging and illustration, and they lead the market in their respective categories. "
Doc173,Adobe ,2001," After announcing our vision for Network Publishing last year, we worked hard to deliver tools that would allow anyone to create, manage, and deliver visually rich communications anytime, anywhere, on any device. The latest version of InDesign software allows the import and export of XML for unique layouts in print and on the Web. Adobe Illustrator 10 enables a dynamic data-driven graphics workflow, automating the most time-consuming production tasks. And Adobe AlterCast software, a new server-based application, allows the customization and delivery of optimized graphics to multiple access devices, including desktop computers, PDAs, and wireless phones. We also unveiled the eXtensible Metadata Platform (XMP), a new open standard for cross-media development that enables the easy and accurate exchange of publishing assets between software applications. Delivering high levels of interoperability, this new protocol opens up exciting opportunities for both Adobe and its strategic partners. "
Doc174,Adobe ,2001," Even though the development of world-class software tools remains a top priority, we begin fiscal 2002 with a renewed commitment to our customers. More than ever, we??re listening carefully to what our customers have to say, implementing product functionality and support levels based on their feedback. Internally, we??ve thoroughly reorganized our Customer Care organization, realigning its goals with those of our field sales teams so that we can more effectively meet our customers?? changing needs. Adobe continues to be equally committed to the needs of our community. Everywhere you look, Adobe employees are donating time, money, and expertise to a number of critical nonprofit causes?including initiatives in the fields of K?12 education, fair housing, and other social services?under the auspices of the Adobe Community Relations program. Adobe also contributed $500,000 in combined employee and corporate donations to the American Red Cross September 11 fund. "
Doc175,Adobe ,2001," Adobe continues to attract the very best talent. Although we slowed our hiring in fiscal 2001, we continued to invest in the future by filling critical positions throughout the year. As eager as we are for their expertise, these employees are equally eager to work for a company that FORTUNE magazine has included in its ??100 Best Companies to Work For?? list four of the last five years. "
Doc176,Adobe ,2001," We??ve all been on an economic roller coaster this past fiscal year. As we look to the near future, we are confident that we can manage Adobe Systems through difficult times. And our focus?as always?is on the long term. Once the current economic malaise subsides, we believe we will be well positioned to drive revenue growth and expand our profitability. We??ve aligned our product road map to match the growing trends we see not only in Network Publishing but also in digital imaging and digital video software. We??re excited about emerging opportunities in areas such as digital photo management, DVD authoring, and Internet printing?new markets we are actively exploring. And we??re charging more than half of our field sales organization with realizing our single largest growth opportunity, Adobe ePaper Solutions. With Acrobat and related products, we??re helping enterprises migrate from paper-based workflows to Web-centric electronic document workflows. "
Doc177,Adobe ,2001," Our market-leading franchise products and their loyal customers, our world-class global operation, and our highly profitable business continue to fuel our excitement about Adobe??s future. We look forward to sharing our ongoing success with you. "
Doc178,Adobe ,2002,"As Adobe Systems?? twentieth year of helping people communicate better comes to a close, we??re pleased to see our customers using Adobe solutions?as well as complementary technologies from our partners?to create, manage, and deliver visually rich information to anyone, anywhere, on any device. For the fourth consecutive year, strong sales of Adobe Acrobat software licenses have contributed to making the enterprise our single greatest market opportunity. We??ve made significant inroads with Adobe InDesign?? page layout software. And Adobe Photoshop Elements software has been embraced by over a million customers as the professional-quality, mid-level digital imaging software of choice. "
Doc179,Adobe ,2002," Still, this past year many of our core customers grappled with unfavorable business conditions and market uncertainty. Design agencies, publishing houses, and other creative organizations faced smaller client budgets and reduced staffing, leading them to decrease their spending on capital expenditures such as new software. As a result of this reduced demand, as well as an overall weakened global economy, our diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2002 decreased by 5% year over year from $0.83 to $0.79, and our operating profit decreased by 24% year over year. In this difficult economic climate, we concentrated on reinforcing our strong market positions and preparing ourselves for the future with increased research and development. "
Doc180,Adobe ,2002," The results of our efforts will allow us to take advantage of several culminating market trends. Cost-conscious enterprises are looking to find greater return on their existing technology investments, creative professionals are looking for ways to save money and improve efficiency, and home and office users need easy-to-use software to help them work with a new generation of digital cameras and video cameras. Adobe plans to roll out solutions that address each of these trends, and we??ve realigned our organization to more effectively deliver these solutions to an eager customer base. "
Doc181,Adobe ,2002," In addition to a strong product roadmap, we remain profitable, with a strong cash position achieved through highly disciplined operational controls. Our transparent reporting system gives us a 24/7 view into worldwide operations, leading to greater efficiencies and reduced costs. Unusual among software companies, this financial strength gives Adobe a competitive advantage and long-term confidence. With a combination of powerful customer-facing solutions and solid bottom-line financials, we will strive to provide strong market leadership and stockholder value as we enter decade number three. "
Doc182,Adobe ,2002," For fiscal year 2002, we are reporting earnings of $191.4 million. This represents a 7% decrease compared with fiscal year 2001. We made changes to our reporting structure, moving some of our products into new categories that more accurately reflect their usage by our customers. Adobe??s Creative Professional revenue was $351.3 million, an 11% decrease over fiscal year 2001. Digital Imaging and Video revenue was $411.9 million, a 6% decrease. Sales of Adobe Acrobat software and related products pushed Adobe ePaper?? solutions application revenue from $291.9 million to $312.5 million, an increase of 7% over fiscal year 2001. Revenue from our OEM PostScript and Other segment declined from $104.8 million to $89.0 million, a decrease of 15%. "
Doc183,Adobe ,2002," During fiscal year 2002, gross margins were 91.0%, compared to 93.4% in fiscal 2001. As a percentage of revenue, research and development expenses were 21.1%, compared to 18.2% in 2001 ? a reflection of Adobe??s commitment to continue to invest in its future. Sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses, as a percent of revenue, were 32.7% and 9.3% respectively ? essentially at the same levels in 2002 when compared to 2001. Thanks to our ongoing financial discipline, we once again end the year in a solid financial position, with $617.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. "
Doc184,Adobe ,2002," Fiscal year 2002 was marked by several highlights. Accelerating our reach into the enterprise was our April acquisition of Accelio. The company??s electronic forms offerings provide the foundation of our newest ePaper solutions, and we anticipate that the acquired expertise in selling into the enterprise should be a major asset moving forward. We introduced several server-based applications, including Adobe?? Document Server, which automates document production and delivers targeted, secure, and reliable electronic documents to virtually any platform a business or government agency may require. "
Doc185,Adobe ,2002," Within the design community, Adobe InDesign 2.0 software gained more customers among publishers and creative agencies worldwide. This version of our next-generation page layout software incorporates several innovative new features to deliver a top-notch application. Since its release in January, InDesign 2.0 has gained significant market share. In April, we released a new version of Adobe Photoshop software to widespread acclaim. And professional videographers working with corporate and broadcast video continued to make Adobe Premiere?? and Adobe After Effects?? software leaders in their category on the Windows?? platform. "
Doc186,Adobe ,2002," Software collections, bringing together several flagship Adobe applications for specific customer requirements, continued to do well. Offering a complete solution, these suites allow customers to adopt multiple Adobe applications simultaneously at a great value. Licensing of Adobe Collections by our customers continues to represent a significant portion of Adobe??s revenue. "
Doc187,Adobe ,2002," In fiscal year 2002, our partnerships became more strategically important. Of particular note is our agreement with enterprise software provider SAP. By integrating Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) technology with SAP solutions, this partnership is an important step toward establishing Adobe as an essential enterprise infrastructure provider. Other important relationships include those with Dell and Documentum. "
Doc188,Adobe ,2002," At a time when investor confidence is being tested, Adobe is committed to closely following all newly established rules, certifications, and board independence requirements, and we will continue to conduct our operations with integrity. "
Doc189,Adobe ,2002," Adobe??s focus for the coming fiscal year is threefold: to extend our business to the enterprise by developing and delivering enterprise-class ePaper solutions, to provide more value to our creative professional customers, and to extend our digital imaging and video businesses to meet the needs of home and business users. Underlying each of these goals is the evolution of Adobe PDF as a robust, rich media container that complements other established standards such as the eXtensible Markup Language (XML). The use of Adobe PDF as a format for reliable, multiplatform communications spans all of Adobe??s customers, including creative professionals, businesses, and government agencies. No other technology today can equal what Adobe PDF provides, and we intend to continue to innovate its functionality?including extending it as a container for delivering digital photographs. "
Doc190,Adobe ,2002," For the enterprise, we are extending our Adobe Acrobat software-based ePaper solutions to help corporations, government agencies, and other large organizations move from paper-based workflows to electronic document-based workflows. Leveraging our reach through the now ubiquitous Acrobat Reader??, we are delivering end-to-end, client- and server-based solutions that help enterprises both save and make money. To support these goals, we are refocusing our direct sales force to sell directly to executives, line of business managers, and IT managers. "
Doc191,Adobe ,2002," We??re also giving increased attention to creative professionals, developing powerful tools that allow them to do their jobs more efficiently, creatively, and at a lower cost. Whether working in the creative departments of large enterprises or as independent professionals, these demanding power users depend on Adobe products to help them create the visually rich content found in newspapers, magazines, on television, on the Web, and in marketing communications of all kinds. Besides continuing to improve the industry-standard applications that are found in nearly every creative professional??s toolbox, we plan to offer newly designed software collections with greater integration and interoperability for enhanced creative workflows. "
Doc192,Adobe ,2002," Lastly, Adobe stands to benefit from the explosive trend of home and business users migrating from analog to digital photography and video. For these customers ? including photography enthusiasts, home users, educators, and office workers in charge of producing corporate videos and internal Web sites? we??re rolling out applications designed to help them master the world of digital expression. In addition to a new version of our well-received Adobe Photoshop Elements software, we recently released Adobe Photoshop Album software. This new Adobe software will help people organize and share their digital photos. We??re also developing a new professional tool for video authoring that creative professionals can use to deliver rich media on a new, portable broadband platform: DVD. "
Doc193,Adobe ,2002," We consider this year to mark not only a twentieth anniversary, but also a birth ; with solid solutions developed and key partnerships established, we are emerging as a key competitive player in the enterprise. The following pages of this Annual Report will show you how we are working to deliver robust solutions that help enterprises communicate better with their employees, their customers, and their business partners. "
Doc194,Adobe ,2002," As we take our mission to help people communicate better into the enterprise, we are determined to uphold the values that make Adobe Systems a great company in every sense of the word. We plan to continue to invest heavily in research and development, creating innovative products and services that meet our customers?? diverse needs. We remain committed to seeking out, hiring, and retaining the most creative employees in the industry. And we are proud of our community involvement: our community relations department sponsors a variety of programs to benefit our local communities, including software donations, cash grants, and volunteer efforts. "
Doc195,Adobe ,2003,"When we think of the word ??platform,?? several concepts come to mind: a strong foundation, a launching pad, an elevated vantage point. Those of you who have followed technology for the last couple of decades have seen several examples of companies that provide foundational platforms on which customers and partners can build their businesses and add value. This year we took a look at the way our own customers have standardized on Adobe software and solutions and came to an inescapable conclusion: Adobe has transformed itself into a platform company. "
Doc196,Adobe ,2003," Not that long ago, Adobe was a company thought of almost exclusively in terms of its products. Today, we provide a foundation of innovative technologies on which our customers can be more creative, save time and money, and run their businesses more efficiently. We??ve built these foundations in three areas: Intelligent Documents, design, and digital imaging. Within each of these domains you??ll find Adobe software tools?as well as complementary technologies from partners?that help our customers share ideas, information, and memories. Together, these platforms represent the foundation of our success in the present and the launching pad of our vision for the future. For our customers, our partners, and you, our stockholders, they also represent a firm place to stand. "
Doc197,Adobe ,2003," Fiscal year 2003 was an excellent year for Adobe Systems. With one of the strongest new product lineups in the company??s history, and more stable global economic conditions, we met or exceeded Wall Street expectations in every quarter in fiscal 2003. In addition, we grew our annual revenue to a record $1.295 billion, representing an 11 percent year-over-year growth when compared with fiscal 2002. Our diluted earnings per share increased from $0.79 to $1.10, and our operating profit margin expanded to more than 29 percent for fiscal 2003. Reported net income from all market segments reached $266.3 million, a 39 percent increase when compared with fiscal 2002. Adobe??s Creative Professional revenue was $368.5 million, a 5 percent increase over fiscal 2002. Digital Imaging and Video revenue was $392.4 million, a 5 percent decrease year over year. Licensing of Adobe Acrobat?? software and related products pushed Adobe ePaper?? Solutions application revenue from $312.6 million in fiscal 2002 to $444.1 million in fiscal 2003, a 42 percent increase year over year. Finally, revenue from our OEM PostScript?? and Other segment was $89.7 million, a 1 percent increase when compared with fiscal 2002. "
Doc198,Adobe ,2003," Due to strong operational cash flows and cash proceeds from stock options, our cash position grew significantly in 2003. Our strong cash position of nearly $1.1 billion provides the flexibility to both invest in our future and continue to return cash to our stockholders through repurchase and our quarterly stock dividend. And by investing approximately 20 percent of our revenue in research and development, we are able to stay at the forefront of the markets we serve. From sales and engineering to marketing and finance, we??ve achieved a level of operational excellence uncommon in the software industry. And, as befits a major software company, we??ve kept our business processes streamlined and accountable. Further, we have deployed centralized information systems that provide real-time financial information to quickly assess our business performance throughout the world. "
Doc199,Adobe ,2003," Ethics and integrity have always been an important part of both Adobe??s culture and our way of doing business, and we take corporate governance very seriously, seeking to achieve the same level of excellence as we do in all other aspects of our business. "
Doc200,Adobe ,2003," We successfully executed the strategy that we outlined for you last year. As promised, in our fastest growing business, ePaper Solutions, we helped enterprises and government agencies migrate their legacy paper-based workflows to electronic document workflows. With the release of Adobe Acrobat 6.0, we not only delivered a strong product, but also segmented the product line to meet a broader set of customer needs: Acrobat Professional for demanding collaborative environments such as the creative professional segment and engineering, Acrobat Standard for working with Adobe PDF across the enterprise, and Acrobat Elements for basic Adobe PDF creation on the desktop. With this strategy we achieved record revenue for this powerful application? in the third quarter alone, Acrobat desktop revenue exceeded $100 million. "
Doc201,Adobe ,2003," We also further extended our Intelligent Document Platform to deliver document services that help connect people to back-end enterprise systems. Allowing large organizations to customize their outbound communications, Adobe Document Server software filled out our offerings for document generation. By making Adobe PDF forms interactive, Adobe Document Server for Reader Extensions delivered document collaboration and electronic forms capabilities to corporations and government agencies around the world. In all of our enterprise initiatives, we differentiated ourselves from the competition by concentrating on the ways that people work with information and business processes, rather than only on the ways that machines talk to other machines. "
Doc202,Adobe ,2003," For our creative professional customers, we fulfilled our promise to add value by delivering the Adobe Creative Suite. With this revolutionary platform, we combined new versions of all of our flagship software products?including Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, and Adobe GoLive???with Version Cue,?? an innovative file management feature, to form a complete solution that allows creative professionals to work in newly efficient, collaborative workflows. Moving forward, we expect that all of the standalone products that are part of the Adobe Creative Suite, as well as the Suite itself, will be updated simultaneously, resulting in higher customer satisfaction and a streamlined product development cycle. Also of note in the creative professional space is the increased adoption of InDesign software as the page layout application of choice for major newspapers, publishers, and advertising agencies. By delivering enhanced creative freedom, an integrated workflow, support for rich media including video, and an ecosystem of service providers and partners, we??re seeing increased adoption of InDesign in this competitive space. "
Doc203,Adobe ,2003," Users of our digital imaging and video software took advantage of several new and important product releases. Digital imaging hobbyists wanting to use the professional power of Adobe Photoshop found tools to retouch, organize, and share their photos in Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Photoshop Album software. With these products, we shared our leading digital imaging platform with a broader range of customers than ever before. Similarly, video professionals gained a complete solution with the release of the Adobe Video Collection, which brings together several leading Adobe digital video products. At the core of the collection is an entirely rewritten version of Adobe Premiere,?? now called Adobe Premiere Pro. With newly improved performance and enhanced capabilities, this video editing tool is poised to lead the market. The collection also includes a major upgrade of Adobe After Effects, as well as two new professional-grade applications: Adobe Encore?? DVD for DVD production and Adobe Audition?? for sound editing. "
Doc204,Adobe ,2003," Just as Adobe has transformed itself into a company that delivers platforms rather than tools or products, our customers?? businesses and markets are transforming in significant ways. By maintaining our strong relationships with our customers, we will anticipate and meet their evolving needs. In the enterprise space, we see the XMLbased interchange of information moving from the pilot phase to everyday reality. To that end, all of our enterprise solutions will incorporate robust XML support in the form of ??Intelligent Documents.?? By combining Adobe PDF with XML, these documents connect people, systems, and processes in innovative ways. In fact, what used to be called the Adobe ePaper Business Unit is now known as the Intelligent Documents Business Unit. With more than half a billion copies of Adobe Reader distributed on all major operating systems and devices, along with the fact that Adobe PDF has become the de facto standard format for the delivery of electronic documents, our customers have an unmatched platform from which they can reliably interact with information. "
Doc205,Adobe ,2003," As broadband and various new access devices continue to proliferate, creative professionals will be called on to repurpose rich media content at an accelerated rate. In the largest production environments, they will also have to manage tens of thousands of digital assets while attempting to streamline workflows. With the Adobe Creative Suite design platform, we help our customers accomplish these demanding imperatives. For example, our new Version Cue technology helps ensure that workgroups of all sizes can work on highly complex, asset-intensive projects collaboratively. And when it comes to Adobe InDesign, we continue to see increased adoption, solidifying our position as the page layout and design solution of choice for users who are eager to make the switch from non-Adobe applications. "
Doc206,Adobe ,2003," In 2003, sales of digital cameras surpassed sales of traditional film cameras, and by the year 2005, it??s expected that 100 percent of video cameras sold will be digital. Our strategy for taking advantage of this opportunity with our digital imaging platform is threefold. First, we will strengthen the leadership of the gold standard for desktop digital imaging, Adobe Photoshop. As we evolve the application??s features to match the next generation of digital photography, we plan to increase market share among influential new customers, including professional photographers. Second, we will continue to extend Photoshop technology to a rapidly growing number of hobbyists and consumers. As these users grow to desire more sophisticated capabilities, they will find a smooth upgrade path from Photoshop Album and Photoshop Elements to the full version of Photoshop. Finally, we expect to provide more market-leading digital video tools?not only for creative professional customers looking to expand their skill sets, but also for video producers within corporations and large organizations who are moving from analog to digital production. "
Doc207,Adobe ,2003," Although Adobe has transformed itself into a platform company, our essential strategy has not dramatically changed. We plan to move forward in our key growth markets, using the power of our technology platforms to meet the needs of customers, effectively leverage an ecosystem of partners, and provide more value to stockholders. As always, we??ll continue to focus on our customers?? perspective, incorporating their input into the way we plan for and develop solutions. And, just as we have for more than twenty years, we??ll count on Adobe innovation as the stimulus for new revenue streams. "
Doc208,Adobe ,2003," For Adobe, being a model employer and responsible corporate citizen has always been an important part of creating stockholder value. We??ve been recognized for many years as one of the ??100 Best Companies to Work For?? by FORTUNE magazine, and we??re especially proud to be listed in the number six position in the 2004 report. By inspiring our employees to contribute at peak performance and share in the success of the company, we??re ensuring a steady rate of innovation and growth. We??re also contributing to our communities and helping to improve the quality of life by addressing critical needs, primarily through schools and nonprofit organizations that reach underserved populations in areas where Adobe employees live and work. "
Doc209,Adobe ,2003," Being a platform company means more than just setting industry standards. It means helping people and businesses communicate better by helping them integrate information, images, and insights. They can do it with the power of Adobe??s innovative technologies, tools, products, and services, and they will do it in new and paradigm-shifting ways over the coming years. Thank you for supporting our efforts, and for standing next to us in this exciting time. "
Doc210,Aspen ,1995,"In fiscal 1995, AspenTech became the first public company in our industry. We demonstrated strong growth in revenues, net income, and shareholder earnings. The Companv consolidated its leadership position with successiul product introductions, new customer partnerships, and an expanded presence in international markets. We made a significant acquisition, which will enable us to capitalize on the emerging trend toward incorporating process modeling into online process control and decision support systems. "
Doc211,Aspen ,1995," Financial results included a 28 percent increase in revenues to 57.5 million from $45.0 million in fiscal 1994. Net income for fiscal 1995 before one time acquisition costs increased 62 percent to $6.0 million, cornpared with $3.7?? million in fiscal 1994. Earnings per share for fiscal 1995 increased 33 percent to $.77, compared with 3.58 in fiscal 1994. "
Doc212,Aspen ,1995," AspenTech's initial public offering in November 1994, followed by a successful secondary offering in early 1995, has enhanced our visibility and attractiveness to the large, multinational companies who are our target market. Forty-rwo of the fifty largest chemical companies in the world are now AspenTech customers, and all of these companies have significant potential to use more of our technology. This year, Huls AG, Sumitomo Chemical Co, Ltd., and Daicel Chemical Industries, joined our community of Global Technology Partners anal stated their intention ro standardize on AspenTech products across their enterprises. We established new relationships with Sasol Chemical Industries, one of the largest chemical companies in South Africa, and Asahi Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. in japan, as well as with leaders in other process industries, including Unilever Research, Phillips Petroleum Company 3M Company, SGN, the French power company, and Lion Company the second largest japanese consumer products company. "
Doc213,Aspen ,1995," To better serve these customers, AspenTech expanded our international operations this year, opening offices in Dusseldorf, Paris, and Osaka. Today, nearly 52 percent of our total revenues come from outside the US. The international strength of the company is something we can easily leverage to deliver synergistic technologies in the future. "
Doc214,Aspen ,1995," Fiscal 1995 product introductions significantly enhanced our solution suite and further differentiated it from those of competitors: SPLIT is a new product that is already producing cost savings for specialty chemicals and consumer products companies in the U.S., Germany, and japan. It enables engineers to determine the best and most cost-effective way of configuring distillation processes for separating the very complex mixtures common in these industries. Companies benefit by quickly finding the best separation schemes, thus avoiding unnecessary capital expenditures and minimizing energy consumption. "
Doc215,Aspen ,1995," By year-end, about 40 companies, including many of the world's leading polymers producers, had begun using our new module POLYMERS PLOS Polymers, which currently represent about 20 percent of total chemicals sales, are the fastest growing and most profitable segment of the business of many of our customers. Because of their extreme complexity, however, polymer production processes have been difficult to model. POLYMERS PLUS simplifies the task by providing an innovative new generic modeling approach that can be applied to a wide class of polymers. We are applying for a US. patent for this unique methodology. "
Doc216,Aspen ,1995," One of the most significant emerging trends in process manufacturing is on-line process optimization. One of the most significant events this year for AspenTech was our acquisition of Industrial Systems, Inc. (ISI), a move that positions us to capitalize on this trend. ISI, based in Bothell, Washington, is a rapidly growing provider of process information management (PIM) software for capturing, displaying, and analyzing plant-wide historical and real time process data. We intend to market ISI's product, ClM/21, on a stand-alone basis and to integrate it with our other products to create a new class of value-added applications that will enable companies not only to model optimal process designs, but also to measure in real time how closely plant performance matches modeled benchmarks. This will enable modeling to make a greater impact on production - an area that has three times the number of chemical engineers of either research & development or engineering yer has been the least penetrated by computer-aided engineering technology. "
Doc217,Aspen ,1995," The two companies also have complementary strengths in marketing and distribution. ISI derives the greatest percentage of its revenue from the pulp and paper market, with chemicals, petroleum, and food close behind, With a small sales force, the company has targeted primarily North American markets. The acquisition will enable ISI to take advantage of AspenTech??s exceptionally deep base in the chemicals industry and of our worldwide infrastructure and sales presence. At the same time, it will enable AspenTech to leverage ISI customer relationships in vertical markets where we are not presently as strong, accelerating our expansion into a broad range of process industries. "
Doc218,Aspen ,1995," The accomplishments of fiscal 1995 have prepared AspenTech for further growth. We are in an excellent position to build on our industry leadership both by continuing to deliver the solutions our customers need, and by bringing together cnmplementary companies that enlarge the ways we can serve them. I am extremely enthusiastic about our plans and our prospects for this fiscal 1996. "
Doc219,Aspen ,1996,"Fiscal 1996 was a year of dramatic accomplishment for AspenTech. In January 1996, we announced the acquisition of two leading suppliers of on-line advanced automation solutions, DMC Corporation (DMCC) and Setpoint, Inc., on the same day. This sent an electrifying message to our industry. Overnight we became the largest company by far dedicated to providing process modeling and advanced automation solutions to the process industries, with the leading market share in every major business area in which we compete. We instantly became a leading supplier to the petroleum industry, complementing our historic strength in the chemicals and other process industries. And we significantly increased our competitive differentiation by becoming the only company that can provide off-line and on-line solutions across the full life-cycle of a process, from research and development to engineering to production. "
Doc220,Aspen ,1996," Fiscal 1996 was also a year of significant financial achievement. Revenues increased 80% to $103.6 million, compared with $57.5 million in fiscal 1995. Net income excluding non-recurring costs for fiscal 1996 was $9.2 million, compared with $6.0 million last year, a 53% increase. Earnings per share excluding non-recurring costs for fiscal 1996 were $1.10, compared with $0.77 for fiscal 1995 "
Doc221,Aspen ,1996," We have naturally focused significant management attention on the integration of DMCC and Setpoint into AspenTech. This has been a particularly challenging task because there were overlapping products and services among these companies, the original AspenTech and Industrial Systems, Inc. (which we acquired in May 1995), in the areas of process information management, advanced control and real-time optimization technology. "
Doc222,Aspen ,1996," I am very pleased to report that the integration process has gone extremely well. We have successfully reorganized operations into new AspenTech divisions, headed by strong management teams, that have established clear strategic and product release plans for the business areas. We have made outstanding progress in producing new software releases that combine the best features from overlapping products while providing existing customers with a forward migration path; ??beta?? test versions of new advanced control and process information management software tools are being released in the fall of 1996. We have created a single, account-focused sales team that is now successfully selling all of the company??s products and services. Most important, the new AspenTech community is working well together, focused far more on the opportunities that lay ahead than on past company affiliations. "
Doc223,Aspen ,1996," The customer response to the acquisitions has been overwhelmingly positive. By being able to provide a more complete solution that touches the full life-cycle of their manufacturing operations, We have become a more strategic supplier to many of our customers. A life-cycle approach offers a number of benefits to customers: it reduces the time and cost required to generate new applications; it facilitates sharing of information between different departments within the company; it reduces the training and support costs of maintaining incompatible software tools; and it helps to create a consistent overall system within the company for managing the analysis and implementation of process technology. Our sales staff and senior management are now routinely working more closely with the top management of process manufacturers to define profit improvement programs that include the systematic use of AspenTech products and services. "
Doc224,Aspen ,1996," We have added considerable depth to our management team in fiscal 1996 to better enable us to manage the growth that lies ahead. Several senior managers from DMCC and Setpoint have joined our management team and bring extensive industry experience, particularly in managing project execution operations. We have added several new executives from outside AspenTech to the management team, including a new Chief Information Officer, General Counsel and vice presidents in software engineering, marketing and human resources. We have also made major investments in the infrastructure necessary to support our expansion, particularly in the area of management information systems. "
Doc225,Aspen ,1996," AspenTech also made two key additions to its Board of Directors during the year. Gresham T. Brebach,Jr. is currently Executive Vice President Client Services of Renaissance Solutions, Inc., a leading provider of management consulting and client/server systems integration services for large corporations. Brebach has also served as Executive Vice President of Digital Consulting, the management consulting division of Digital Equipment Corporation, and as head of the North American Information Technology/Services consulting practice of McKinsey Company; he brings tremendous expertise in managing value-added service businesses to the Board. Alison Ross heads Smart Finance  Company, an investment banking advisory service for technology companies. Prior to founding Smart Finance, Ross led the software investment banking effort of Montgomery Securities. Ross?? independent perspective and expertise in financing strategies have already been of great value to the company. "
Doc226,Aspen ,1996," AspenTech has never been stronger than it is today. The acquisitions in the on-line areas have greatly expanded the size of our available market and have significantly increased our opportunity to cross-sell products and services to our customer base. We remain the technology leader in off-line modeling, and the on-line businesses that we acquired also lead their fields technically. In addition, we are continuing to attract the top people in our industry to work at AspenTech. I am extremely enthusiastic about our prospects for the Future. "
Doc227,Aspen ,1996," Our primary focus for 1997 will be on delivering releases of new, integrated products and on expanding our project execution capability, particularly in advanced control and optimization. We expect to continue to be opportunistic regarding potential acquisitions that fit with our focus of delivering solutions based upon fundamental process knowledge to industry. And we will continue both to increase our penetration within existing customers and to expand our strength in vertical markets beyond chemicals and petroleum. "
Doc228,Aspen ,1996," I would like to thank our employees for their dedication to meeting our business objectives while successfully bringing AspenTech and our acquisitions together this past year, and our shareholders for their continued confidence. "
Doc229,Aspen ,1997,"Fiscal 1997 was a year of tremendous achievement for AspenTech. By focusing on our True Potential, we began to realize the vision of enabling our customers to achieve theirs. We are now truly the only company that offers a complete solution for customers encompassing both off-line modeling and simulation and on-line automation, consisting of both software and the services to implement them. During fiscal 1997 we completed the integration of Setpoint and DMCC. On the technology front, we acquired three companies to add strategic new technologies; we created a new team to deliver services for advanced process design; we released several major new products; we established strategic relationships with a number of major customers; and we intensified our focus on the large and rapidly growing Smart Manufacturing marketplace. "
Doc230,Aspen ,1997," Fiscal 1997 was also a year of record financial results. Revenues increased 74% to $180.3 million compared with $103.6 million for fiscal 1996. Net income excluding nonrecurring costs rose 118% to $20.1 million for fiscal 1997 compared with $9.2 million the year before. Earnings per share excluding nonrecurring costs for fiscal 1997 were $0.96 compared with $0.55 for fiscal 1996, adjusted to reflect a two-for-one stock split effective February 28, 1997. A portion of this growth was attributed to the acquisitions of DMCC and Setpoint. Our successful integration of these companies makes us enthusiastic about the opportunities for robust revenue growth and further margin expansion in the future. "
Doc231,Aspen ,1997," We acquired three businesses during fiscal 1997, each of which provided strategic capabilities. In October 1996 we announced the acquisition of the process control division of Cambridge Control Limited, located in Cambridge, England, adding capacity to execute advanced process control projects in Europe. We also announced the acquisition of B-JAC International, a leading supplier of detailed heat exchanger modeling software, based in Richmond, Virginia, which allowed us to tightly link the B-JAC?? tools with ASPEN PLUS?? to provide customers with a common model from design through the specifications with their equipment manufacturers. In January 1997 we acquired Bechtel??s PIMS (Process Industries Modeling System) business, adding to our family market-leading software products for economic planning and scheduling based on linear programming technology. This acquisition was very strategic for us because now we are able to integrate the PIMS software with our solutions for on-line optimization to deliver production planning integrated with on-line closed-loop optimization. "
Doc232,Aspen ,1997," We were active in delivering new releases of several important products. By January 1997 we had shipped unified products from the merged companies: InfoPlus.21?? for process information management, DMCplus?? for advanced control, and RT-OPT?? for real-time optimization. In March 1997 we shipped the first commercial release of BATCH PLUS?? for modeling of complex, recipe-based pharmaceutical and batch chemical processes. AspenTech worked closely with key customers, including Merck, to develop this product, which was one of the most successful new products in AspenTech??s history. It generated more than $1 million of revenue in the first quarter after its release. In May 1997 we shipped DynaPLUS,?? a system that lets users create a rigorous dynamic model of a process from an ASPEN PLUS model in a fraction of the time that was previously required. In May 1997 we also shipped the Windows?? release of ADVENT?? for process integration and synthesis, to bring all of the power of ADVENT to the Windows 95 and NT environments. "
Doc233,Aspen ,1997," In addition to world-class products, we also focus on providing highest-quality customer support. In November 1996 AspenTech was awarded the prestigious STAR Award, presented annually by the Software Support Professionals Association (SSPA) for delivering exceptional software support to its worldwide customer base. AspenTech is the only software and services vendor supporting the process manufacturing industry to have received this recognition since the award??s inception in 1990. "
Doc234,Aspen ,1997," During fiscal 1997 we intensified our focus on the large and rapidly growing marketplace for the Smart Manufacturing System. These systems provide integrated technology for design, operation, and management of process manufacturing systems based upon a common, consistent set of core models of a process. The models are based upon fundamental engineering knowledge. They provide a framework that can be used over the life cycle of a process, from development to design to production. During manufacturing operations, the Smart Manufacturing System provides a complete integrated system for manufacturing execution between the enterprise resource planning system and the distributed control system in the field. "
Doc235,Aspen ,1997," To accelerate our Smart Manufacturing System offering, in April we announced the formation of a strategic alliance with Lyondell Petrochemical Company to work jointly to develop and implement a prototype of the Smart Manufacturing System at Lyondell??s Matagorda County, Texas facility. In May we announced the formation of a strategic alliance with SAP America to provide integrated business and manufacturing solutions to the process industries. Both AspenTech and SAP will be working closely together to enable Lyondell to achieve a dramatic improvement in their manufacturing work processes as a result of the prototype system. "
Doc236,Aspen ,1997," We also announced major alliances and special customer relationships with DSM, Pequiven, BP Oil International, The Dow Chemical Company, and Phelps Dodge to work closely together to execute a program to implement solutions based on our off-line modeling and simulation and on-line automation technologies. These customers have recognized that by committing to a program co-managed by AspenTech and themselves, they can implement the technologies faster and achieve quicker economic returns than by contracting for individual projects one at a time. "
Doc237,Aspen ,1997, During fiscal 1997 we added management talent. Steve Doyle joined the company as General Counsel and Ernie Valentine as Vice President for Human Resources. In June 1997 we appointed David McQuillin Executive Vice President for Worldwide Sales and Marketing. These individuals bring strong experience to our organization and position us for the next phase of growth. 
Doc238,Aspen ,1997," Bill Rousseau, who served as a Director of AspenTech since it was founded in 1981, retired from the position in December 1996. Bill and his wife Margaret were the first outside investors in AspenTech, and their support and guidance played a key role in our success. I would like to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude for the many contributions that Bill has made over the years. "
Doc239,Aspen ,1997," Our primary focus for fiscal 1998 will be on delivering the Windows NT releases of ASPEN PLUS and SPEEDUP as well as Release 3.2 of RT-OPT, and upon growing our services capability to execute the automation projects for which we are seeing strong demand. Much of our growth will continue to come from existing customers, and we expect to establish additional strategic alliances and relationships with major customers. We will extend our role in the Smart Manufacturing space by increasing the levels of integration among all our technologies and by building relationships with partners. We will continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts to focus on vertical markets outside chemicals and petroleum, with particular emphasis on the pharmaceutical industry. We will continue to be opportunistic regarding strategic acquisitions that fit within our focus of delivering solutions based on fundamental process knowledge to industry. "
Doc240,Aspen ,1997," In conclusion, I would like to thank our employees for their contributions and hard work during a time of transition and change. I thank our customers for their support and enthusiasm for our vision of Smart Manufacturing and for their patience. And I thank our shareholders for their continued confidence. "
Doc241,Aspen ,1998,"Fiscal 1998 was a year of contrasts for AspenTech numerous accomplishments that meaningfully strengthened our competitive position, along with execution challenge at the end of the fourth quarter. we began the year by introducing the plantelligence concept at a highly successful aspenworld 97 conference in october. this major industry event that we host every three years for our customers was attended by 1500 people. as the year unfolded we acquired eight companies, including cheaspeake decision sciences, to add strategic technologies, to extend the range of solutions we provide, and to broaden the target markets we serve. we released a number of major new products, we established new strategic customer relationships; and we raised capital sufficiently to fund our growth. "
Doc242,Aspen ,1998," notwithstanding an earnings disappointment in the fourth quarter, caused by an overrun in expenses, aspentech achieved record financial results for the year. total revenues increased 30% to 254 million compared with 194 million for fiscal 1997. net income, excluding nonrecurring costs, rose 31% to 27.7 million for fiscal 1998 were 1.11 compared with 0.93 for fiscal 1997. all of these numbers include the historical results of chesapeake restated as a pooling of interests transaction. "
Doc243,Aspen ,1998," the launch at aspenworld of plantelligence, aspentech's integrated suite of products and services to support smart manufacturing, was enthusiastically received by our customers. the smart manufacturing market space, first described by industry observers in 1997, describes the integration of advanced modeling, automation and information technologies to create a computer system enabling customers to design, operate and manage their manufacturing processes closer to their true potential plantelligence provides a framework for integrating our products based upon open standards such as . "
Doc244,Aspen ,1998," we acquired eight companies in fiscal 1998, each of which provided strategic capabilities. in august 1997, we announced the acquisition of special analysis and simulation technologies, ltd (SAST), a global leader in dynamic simulation and operator training services and application, based in the uk. we also announced the acquisition of neuralware, a leading provider of neural network and related technologies, to enable us to incorporate neural network technology into our solutions for advanced control, process modeling, and information management. in march 1998, we announced three acquisitions: cimtech sa-nv, a leading european supplier of process information management systems, headquartered in belgium; contas process control an advanced process control consulting firm, based in italy and iisys inc a developer of advanced software technology used by process manufacturers to collect, reconcile and report yield-accounting information, located in houston. in april 1998, we reported the acquisition of the uk-based zyqad ltd, which provides software for managing the workflow among a team of engineers designing new process plants or improving existing facilities. "
Doc245,Aspen ,1998," the announcement at the end of april 1998 that aspentech had acquired chesapeake dedcision sciences, a leading supplier of highly configurable software solutions for the rapidly growing supply chain market, had a dramatic impact on our marketplace. we changed the competitive playing field with the ability to extend our solutions beyond the optimization of an individual plant to encompass optimization of the entire manufacturing enterprise. our mandate was greatly expanded to include not only the manufacturing process but also processes along the entire supply chain from raw materials procedurement and inventory control to demand forecasting and distribution. the addition of supply chain optimization is a natural extension to plantelligence. "
Doc246,Aspen ,1998," finally, in june 1998 we completed the acquisition of treiber controls inc a leading provider of advanced process control and real-time optimization technologies and services based in canada. this acquisition added valuable project execution capacity in canada to serve our core markets of petroleum refining and petrochemicals and it also provided unique applications skills in the important emerging markets of polymers natural gas and pulp and paper. "
Doc247,Aspen ,1998," we were active in delivering new releases of many of our products. in april 1998 we shipped our flagship process modeling system, aspen plus 10.0, with many new engineering capabilities and a greatly improved ability to interoperate with other software using the latest windows standards. other major product releases during the year included rt-opt 3.0 which provides tight integration between off-line simulation and design using aspen plus and equation-based real-time optimization on the plant floor, and aspen pims 10.0 the process industry's most widely used system for linear-programming-based optimization of economic planning and scheduling of production facilities. we completed aspen watch a new product to allow customers to monitor the performance their dmcplus advanced control system and to improve its performance over time. we also shipped new releases of infoplus21, the industry's leading real-time data historian for process information management, and aspen process explorer 2.0, the desktop client for displaying and accessing the data. in may 1998 we announced the availability of the aspen engineering suite, which realigned and repackaged all of our modeling and simulation products to make them easier to understand, configure and sell. the suite is comprised of major new versions of eight of aspentech's key modeling products and aspen zyqad. all of our new product releases fully support the microsoft windows nt and windows 95 operating systems. "
Doc248,Aspen ,1998," we announced major customer alliences with valero energy group, bayer ag, westlake group, ici and statoil. the work we have been doing with lyondell chemical to implement plantelligence at its facility in matagorda country, texas achieved an important milestone as lyondell elected to license plantelligence to implement aspentech solutions at nine additional manufacturing facilities. during the year we also announced a strategic alliance with intergraph to develop and market integrated solutions for process and physical plant design, operations and management. "
Doc249,Aspen ,1998," the key challenge for aspentech going forward is to be able to successfully execute our strategy to lead the emerging marketplace for smart manufacturing. going into the next fiscal year, we have realigned the focus of our management team to best match the talents of our people with the jobs most critical to our success. mary palermo has exchanged her chief financial officer duties for a promotion to a senior operating role as executive vice president with general management responsibility for the advanced control and optimization and the information management divisions. succeeding her as chief financial officer is lisa zappala, who is a skilled financial executive with a strong operational focus. david mcquiilin, executive vice president for worldwide sales and marketing, has taken on additional responsibility for the operations of the chesapeake supply chain division. david mushin was promoted to the position of senior vice president of operations based at headquarters to focus on improving the efficiency of our operations and building the infrastructure to streamline work processes and manage our expenses. each of these professionals brings to their new positions extensive knowledge of the company, of our industry, and of our customers. we are also fortunate that along with the companies we've acquired in recent years have come seasoned managers who are an integral part of the new structure to support our growth. "
Doc250,Aspen ,1998," despite the many positive accomplishments of the year, we were disappointed that for the first time since our initial public offering, we failed to meet analysts' expectations for earnings in the fourth quarter. the earnings miss underscores that the most critical factors for our success are execution, execution and execution. the organizational changes will provide a new focus on the challenge of execution. the management team is committed to restoring the company to its historical levels of financial performance. "
Doc251,Aspen ,1998," oour goal in fiscal 1999 will be to achieve profitable growth through careful expense management, expanding software revenues, and focusing on improvement of services execution. we will focus our r&d investments on integrating our technologies and developing the plantelligence framework as well as keeping the individual technologies best in class. we expect to expand alliances with key industry partners who can complement the solutions we provide with additional technology or additional market presence. "
Doc252,Aspen ,1998," i want to thank our employees, whose energy has enabled us to reach these important milestones, and upon whom we are relying to achieve an even more ambitious set of goals in the year ahead. our customers have embraced our vision for the next generation of technology and products and we appreciate very much that vote of confidence. the management team at aspentech is committed to improving our financial performance and to increasing shareholder value in the process. we look forward to reporting our progress in the coming fiscal year. "
Doc253,Aspen ,1999,"Fiscal 1999 was a year of challenges and opportunities for AspenTech. Despite important accomplishments and numerous successful customer implementations, financial challenges arose as two of our end-user industries, petroleum refining and petrochemicals, faced severe pressures on their businesses. In many cases, these pressures led to mergers, acquisitions or other restructuring, causing customers to delay or defer purchasing decisions. As a result, our software license revenues for fiscal 1999 were below fiscal 1998 levels, and we reported a loss for the year. "
Doc254,Aspen ,1999," In spite of the economic challenges, we significantly strengthened our relationships with many of our largest customers. We announced major expansions of agreements with Equistar Chemicals and Lyondell Chemicals, BP Amoco, Exxon Research and Engineering, and Air Products & Chemicals -- clear evidence of the tremendous economic value we deliver. "
Doc255,Aspen ,1999," To address the challenges we faced in the industry, we commissioned and completed a thorough study of our strategy, which helped to clearly articulate AspenTech's opportunities. We carefully analyzed the markets for our solutions, our competitive advantages and unique competencies, as well as areas of our business where our efficiency could be improved or where new initiatives might be appropriate. The results of the strategy study confirm a large, rapidly growing market for our solutions and lay out an action plan for maintaining our leadership in serving this market. During the past several months, we have begun to implement this plan and have completed an organizational realignment that strengthens the company as we begin a new fiscal year. As we enter the 21st century, I believe that we are well positioned to extend our industry leadership and enable both AspenTech and our customers to achieve True Potential "
Doc256,Aspen ,1999, The analysis of the market opportunities for AspenTech's solutions identified three engines that will drive the company's future growth. 
Doc257,Aspen ,1999," focused solutions These solutions, based on our traditional software technologies, are used to design, operate and manage process manufacturing plants, as well as to optimize the supply chain of an enterprise. Focused solutions consist of individual products and services such as Aspen PlusTM for process simulation, DMCplusTM for advanced control, Aspen RT-Opt TM for real-time process optimization, InfoPlus.21TM for information manage-ment,Aspen PIMSTM and Aspen MIMITM for planning and scheduling plant and supply chain activities, and Aspen Zyqad for engineering work-flow management. "
Doc258,Aspen ,1999," integrated plant solutions These solutions utilize multiple AspenTech products in a common framework to comprise the PlantelligenceTM solution. By inte-grating these products, customers are able to improve their work processes in the plant and dramatically increase the productivity of their manu-facturing operations. AspenTech is the only company to offer an integrated suite of products. Integration will drive both the company's growth and the future direction of the industry. "
Doc259,Aspen ,1999," enterprise optimization solutions AspenTech's enterprise optimization solutions expand the scope of our products beyond the plant gate to encompass multiple facets of the enterprise. These solutions combine our integrated plant technology with the Aspen Supply Chain suite of products to enable companies to coordinate their plant assets and collaborate with trading partners, customers and suppliers. By optimizing plant operations and collapsing the supply chain, companies are able to maximize the level of savings they can attain. "
Doc260,Aspen ,1999," Analysis shows that in 1999 the total annual potential market for these three types of solutions in AspenTech's core market segments of petroleum refining, petrochemicals, polymers, specialty chemicals and life sciences is $10.6 billion annually. With a served market in 1999 of $1.1 billion, the overall market is less than 10% penetrated and is growing at approximately 30% per year. The markets for integrated plant and enterprise optimization solutions are at very early stages of development and are growing faster, in the range of 35-40% per year. The growth of the mature market for focused solutions, which has grown at about 25% per year for the past decade, is expected to slow to 15-20% per year, but on a large base. "
Doc261,Aspen ,1999," In addition to these core vertical markets, AspenTech derives roughly 20-25% of its business today from other segments of the process industries, including consumer packaged goods, food and beverage, high-tech and semiconductors, pulp and paper, metals and minerals, and electric power. In each of these industries, we have a strong position in one or more key technologies with blue-chip customers and they represent important avenues of additional growth for the company. While revenues from our largest vertical markets of petroleum refining and petrochemicals declined due to the restructuring of these industries, we believe the long-term impact will be positive. AspenTech's solutions enable restructured enterprises to increase productivity and improve their competitiveness with a low-cost, low-risk, high-return investment. As enterprises emerge from these restructurings, we expect our solutions to be at or near the top of the list of priorities based on the attractive return on investment they provide. "
Doc262,Aspen ,1999, Our market research confirmed a number of competitive advantages and core strengths of the company: 
Doc263,Aspen ,1999," We have the largest and strongest franchise in the industry based on strong, longstanding customer relationships with almost all of the major process manufacturers worldwide. We have an excellent reputation with our blue-chip cus-tomer base because of the strength of our technology, the skill of our people and the clarity of our vision. "
Doc264,Aspen ,1999," We are the clear market and technology leader. During the past decade, AspenTech was first to market with a long list of breakthrough technologies that transformed the industry and led to our dominant position. We have the leading market share in the majority of our core technologies. "
Doc265,Aspen ,1999," We are strategically positioned for long-term growth. We are the only company that offers an integrated solution that enables process manufacturers to optimize both their plants and their enterprises, including the extended enterprise that encompasses the supply chain. "
Doc266,Aspen ,1999," Focus on integrated plant solutions and enterprise optimization solutions as the primary engines that will drive our future growth. Due to the significant economic returns these technologies can provide for companies, it will be essential for manufacturers to adopt these solutions in order to be competitive in the future. "
Doc267,Aspen ,1999," Maintain our leadership in focused solutions. In order to extend our current lead, we must continue to invest in R&D and focus that investment in the areas that are critical for our customers' success. "
Doc268,Aspen ,1999," Continue our development and deployment of the Aspen Framework, AspenTech's platform for delivering integrated solutions. "
Doc269,Aspen ,1999, Focus on vertical industries. We have created Industry Business Units for each of our core vertical markets and given these units the responsibility for developing the value proposition and defining the enterprise optimization solution for each industry. 
Doc270,Aspen ,1999," Expand our network of partners. We believe we can optimize the growth of the business by working with third parties to help sell and implement our solutions and expand the market opportunity. We expect this effort will include working with world-class business consultants, system integrators, complementary software vendors and other companies with expertise that can accelerate our growth and enable us to penetrate new accounts more rapidly. "
Doc271,Aspen ,1999," Incorporate the internet into everything we do. This initiative includes making our products web-enabled, providing full support for e-commerce, facilitating inter-business collaboration among our customers and exploring new business models made possible by the web. "
Doc272,Aspen ,1999," The strategy outlined above focuses on the long-term growth and success of our business. We have made a number of operational changes that we believe will better enable us to execute the strategy, make us more efficient and restore AspenTech to attractive financial performance and increased returns for shareholders. "
Doc273,Aspen ,1999," We have established four Industry Business Units (IBU) to heighten our vertical industry focus on our key markets. The leaders of these IBUs have outstanding reputations in their industries, possess the expertise to develop specific industry solutions and will create market strategies to deliver the technologies. "
Doc274,Aspen ,1999," We have formed a single product development organization. This organization will facilitate the rapid integration of our products, the sharing of common components, the creation of a common look and feel to our product and the reduction of duplicative effort. "
Doc275,Aspen ,1999, We have created a single global solutions organization uniting all of the various technical disciplines within AspenTech. This organization will facilitate the delivery of solutions that involve multiple technologies and integrated systems and provide better career paths for our services professionals. 
Doc276,Aspen ,1999," We have formed a single, global customer support organization to improve the quality of our services and more effectively respond to customers. "
Doc277,Aspen ,1999," We will continue to operate the supply chain business as an independent business unit. AspenTech's supply chain business is growing rapidly and can best be supported by allowing it to operate independently from our other units. However, the sales, product development and services and support teams for supply chain will be closely coordinated with the other organizational units. "
Doc278,Aspen ,1999, Our customers have welcomed this new organizational structure because it better integrates the 17 organizations that were merged into AspenTech over the past five years and has enabled us to achieve our goal of truly becoming one company. 
Doc279,Aspen ,1999," As we enter the new fiscal year, we have improved our financial stability by substantially reducing our level of operating expenses. This reduction lowers the company's breakeven point, enabling AspenTech to return to profitability at the lower revenue levels we expect in the near term as the health of our end-user markets begins to improve. We have also increased our revenue opportunities by expanding our offerings beyond our core markets and our balance sheet remains solid, with nearly $100 million in cash. "
Doc280,Aspen ,1999," AspenTech has a long history of delivering solid financial performance. In the four years after we went public, we grew our revenues five-fold and met or exceeded Wall Street estimates for 15 consecutive quarters. The management team is very much committed to restoring the company to solid financial performance and improving its valuation. I believe the strategy we have articulated and the organizational changes we have implemented puts AspenTech in an excellent position to take advantage of a tremendous market opportunity. "
Doc281,Aspen ,1999," I thank our employees, who have worked very hard during challenging times with loyalty and dedication, our customers who have worked closely with us with enthusiasm and understanding, and our shareholders who have supported us in difficult times with confidence. We look forward to reporting our progress in the coming fiscal year. "
Doc282,Aspen ,2000,"This year we made a commitment to ourselves, our customers and our shareholders that we would lead the process industries into the networked economy. We are succeeding. This success is evidenced by the company??s significant accomplishments in fiscal 2000. Operationally, we achieved a rapid and dramatic turnaround from the challenges we faced in fiscal 1999. Our financial results in fiscal 2000 reflect this resurgence in customer investment and give us confidence that our strategy is sound and that we are well positioned for additional growth. This momentum is evidence of robust market demand, the competitiveness of our solutions and the capabilities of our sales team. The management team is very proud that we were able to return AspenTech to profitability in such a short period of time. "
Doc283,Aspen ,2000," At the start of the year, we clearly articulated our key strategic priorities:   Focus on core markets in the process industries, where our domain expertise is unparalleled;   Emphasize integrated solutions, including our plant and supply chain offerings, where the growth opportunities are the most compelling;   Expand our industry partnerships, particularly with providers of implementation services and differentiated technology;   Strengthen and diversify our vertical market solutions where process expertise can create dramatic economic value; and   Leverage the Internet across a variety of new and existing business models. "
Doc284,Aspen ,2000," I am pleased with our execution in these endeavors, how quickly we acted to implement these goals, and with the early, demonstrable success we have achieved. Our accomplishments have generated excitement among our customers and partners, enthusiasm among our employees, and support of our plans and progress by investors. "
Doc285,Aspen ,2000," Signs of our early success are apparent on many levels.Focus on our core markets paid off handsomely, as these sectors returned to more vigorous investment patterns. Evidence of this strong customer demand was reflected in our 37% license revenue growth for the year, as process manufacturers more aggressively deployed software solutions to optimize their enterprises. This license growth was also complemented by a strong ramp-up in the backlog of our services business, which topped more than $115 million at the end of fiscal 2000. "
Doc286,Aspen ,2000," Our strong emphasis on integrated solutions was also a big success, with revenues attributable to Plantelligence??, our integrated, plant-wide solution, and supply chain optimization offerings more than doubling over fiscal 1999 levels. Key Plantelligence wins included BP Oil, BP Chemicals, Union Carbide, Sunoco, Formosa Petrochemicals, Rohm and Haas, Air Liquide and Lyondell-Equistar. "
Doc287,Aspen ,2000," Key supply chain wins included Bayer, BP Chemicals, Baxter Healthcare, Borden Chemical, Chevron-Phillips Chemicals, Marathon Ashland Petroleum, Nova Chemicals, Hercules Chemicals and Johns Manville. The ARC Advisory Group recently estimated that AspenTech??s supply chain market share in the chemical and petroleum industries was 46%, evidence of our strong competitive position and clear technical superiority for process industry applications. Our plant and supply chain offerings each accounted for approximately 30% of our license revenue in fiscal 2000, with the balance coming from individual, best-in-class point solutions. "
Doc288,Aspen ,2000," To enhance our marketplace visibility and implementation capabilities, we established significant new marketing, sales, and services partnerships with IBM, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Origin. Each of these relationships has already been solidified through the influence of high-profile license transactions. Early in the year, we formed a relationship with Extricity Software to integrate its B2B collaboration application with our extended supply chain solution for process industry customers. On the vertical market front, we strengthened our position in the petroleum sector, acquiring Petrolsoft Corporation to create the first end-to-end, truly comprehensive supply chain solution, from the wellhead to the gas pump. We also expanded our batch manufacturing capabilities for pharmaceutical manufacturers by acquiring M2R Inc., and we formed an alliance with Union Carbide to jointly provide enterprise optimization solutions to leading polymers producers worldwide. "
Doc289,Aspen ,2000," More than 2,300 leaders from the process industries attended AspenWorld 2000, our industry-wide conference held every three years. At the conference, we demonstrated our fully integrated Plantelligence and supply chain solutions to customers from each of our vertical markets and we unveiled our new company logo and the tagline process. to the power of e. This rebranding reflects AspenTech??s focus on being the trusted e-business provider for process manufacturers. Some of our recent e-business initiatives include launching a collaborative digital marketplace for the petroleum industry, PetroVantage??; forming e-Catalysts, Inc., a new on-line B2B exchange for the catalysts industry, building an industry portal for process industry professionals, ProcessCity.com; and forming an alliance with e-Chemicals. We are squarely positioned as the e-business leader for the process industries. Our solutions and capabilities in e-business have been extremely well received, as process manufacturers are just beginning to consider how these trends will affect their businesses and how they can embrace these B2B technologies to gain a competitive advantage. "
Doc290,Aspen ,2000," Leaders in the process industries are increasingly aware that the Internet has the potential to revolutionize the way they operate. As e-business spreads globally, our customers are now seeking opportunities to create new sources of value   solutions that enable them to make faster, more profitable decisions with both their customers and their suppliers. Those firms that can better integrate planning, scheduling and production systems can optimize their manufacturing plants and supply chains, improving asset utilization and manufacturing throughputs. This integration will enable them to reduce inventories and lower operating costs. Additionally, the ability to respond quickly across the critical supply chain, manufacturing and engineering dimensions can increase customer satisfaction and improve marketplace agility. "
Doc291,Aspen ,2000," In order to remain competitive, industry leaders are accelerating their adoption of e-business infrastructure solutions, and other companies are beginning to follow. As process manufacturers create e-business strategies and determine which technologies to deploy, AspenTech has never been better positioned to meet the needs of these customers. We have the credibility as the right company to lead the process industries into the new digital economy, and our vision has resonated with our customers, partners and analysts. We also uniquely possess two important requisites for successfully deploying B2B solutions in our industries: e-business savvy and unparalleled process industry expertise. No one else offers both, and neither is sufficient alone. "
Doc292,Aspen ,2000," We have built an outstanding team of extraordinarily dedicated people, an unsurpassed suite of products, and the infrastructure necessary to support our growth. In that regard, I am pleased to welcome to our Board of Directors two new members, Stephen Brown, Chairman of John Hancock Financial Services, and Stephen Jennings, Director of Monitor Group. Each of these individuals brings considerable management talent, and their experience will be instrumental in guiding the future direction of AspenTech. "
Doc293,Aspen ,2000," As we look ahead, we are extremely enthusiastic about the prospects we see to transform our industry and grow our business significantly as process manufacturers are compelled to deploy new technologies in order to gear up for e-business. We believe demand for our solutions will continue to be robust because the return on investment for our offerings is so compelling. We have outlined three major operational objectives for the coming fiscal year that we believe will position us for continued growth.   Continue to lead the market for plant-wide solutions, as customers recognize the role our integrated Plantelligence solutions will play in providing the solid plant level infrastructure on which to build their e-business initiatives   Extend our leadership in supply chain for the process industries by building on our unparalleled domain expertise and our unique ability to meet the complex requirements of this industry   Capture e-business leadership in the process industries by providing technology for the major process industry e-marketplaces and enabling customers to implement collaborative solutions with their customers and other trading partners. "
Doc294,Aspen ,2000," Our entire company is focused on these goals. We will succeed by focusing on creating customer value, achieving operational excellence, capturing customer and investor mind share and making AspenTech a magnet for outstanding talent. We thank our customers, partners, employees, and shareholders for the loyalty and confidence you have shown this past year, and we look forward to additional success in the year ahead. Throughout the following pages of this annual report, I will answer several questions as a way to share with you the reasons we believe AspenTech is poised to capture a significant portion of this exciting market opportunity. "
Doc295,Aspen ,2001,"Fiscal 2001 was a year of great contrasts for AspenTech. Despite very robust demand during the first six months of the year, we were not immune to the challenging economic environment, which slowed our growth and negatively affected our profitability during the second half of the year. "
Doc296,Aspen ,2001," In spite of these challenges, I am proud of the many accomplishments that have extended our market leadership and positioned us for success as we look to the fiscal year ahead. I want to share with you several reasons why I am excited about the future of AspenTech. "
Doc297,Aspen ,2001," We launched a major new campaign, Aspen ProfitAdvantage, which sharpens our message to C-level executives on how AspenTech solutions improve profits by increasing revenues, decreasing operating costs and reducing fixed and working capital requirements. Our solutions bring bottom-line benefits that typically amount to as much as 4 to 6 percent of revenues. The Aspen ProfitAdvantage message is resonating with process industry executives who see the opportunity to quickly implement solutions that can significantly increase their operating profits and deliver value to their shareholders. "
Doc298,Aspen ,2001," We achieved record growth in our engineering business as we expanded the breadth and functionality of our asset optimization solutions. These products enable companies to improve functions such as process design and engineering, and construction and start-up. By using these solutions to create accurate models, they also form the foundation to optimize the plant and the enterprise-wide supply chain. We closed large transactions during the year for these solutions with BP, The Dow Chemical Company, Fluor Daniel, Foster Wheeler, Jacobs Engineering, Mitsui Chemicals Inc. and Pemex. "
Doc299,Aspen ,2001," We increased our leading share of the process industry supply chain market, with multimillion dollar head-to-head competitive wins at Chevron, FPCO in Japan, Johns Manville, Petro-Canada Sasol Polymers, Sinopec Corp. and Yukos, a major refiner in Russia. According to ARC Advisory Group, AspenTech had a more than 50 percent market share for supply chain planning and scheduling in the refining and chemicals market in the year 2000. This leading market share continues to be evidence of the importance of our domain expertise and broad solution set in solving problems for process manufacturers. Our solution set not only allows customers to create optimal operating plans, but also provides the supply chain execution technologies required to help customers execute that plan in real-time, a capability that is unique in the marketplace. "
Doc300,Aspen ,2001," We integrated and leveraged several strategic acquisitions of people, products and technologies, adding value that accelerated demand for our engineering and supply chain solutions. Our acquisition of ICARUS added cost-estimation capabilities to our already best-in-class collaborative engineering suite. The addition of Petrolsoft just before the beginning of the year led to record growth in our downstream supply chain solutions for the petroleum industry. The purchase of e-Chemicals' technology broadened and expanded the development of our marketplace solutions, while the addition of the Houston Consulting Group will combine their industry-leading refinery scheduling technology with our refinery planning solution, where we have a dominant market share. We were pleased with the success of these acquisitions and expect that they will be an important component of our future growth as we expand the total solution we will deliver to our customers. "
Doc301,Aspen ,2001," We made progress on our strategy to leverage implementation partners as our partner relationships grew in strength and in number, bringing AspenTech's capabilities to the forefront of key industry thought-leaders. In addition to working closely with IBM Gobal Solutions and PricewaterhouseCoopers during the year, we formed a new relationship with Accenture to add to the breadth of our systems integrator partners. Partners accounted for approximately 10 percent of our license revenues this fiscal year and will be an important part of our growth in the future. Additionally, we formed a technology relationship with Optimum Logistics to improve our downstream and supply chain logistics solutions for the bulk chemicals industry. "
Doc302,Aspen ,2001," We broadened and deepened our senior management team, with key hires who not only bring essential skills and experience, but leverage the time, knowledge and value of our most senior executives, whose duties have significantly expanded. These additions will particularly help us to improve our initiatives in sales, human resources, and research and development. "
Doc303,Aspen ,2001," We achieved a number of important product milestones that dramatically improved our competitive position and extended our industry-leading solutions. Among the highlights of fiscal 2001 was the creation of PetroVantage-, a solution for optimizing and coordinating the trading and logistics decisions and workflow for petroleum and refined products. We announced the concept in September 2000, signed up 10 pilot customers by the spring, and launched the commercial version of the solution in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. While we have invested substantial capital resources in PetroVantage, we expect that it has the potential to generate hundreds of millions of dollars of predictable, subscription revenues annually for AspenTech and create considerable value for shareholders. It is also a critical component of our end-to-end solution for the petroleum industry. No other vendor can come close to the value we can provide to this industry. "
Doc304,Aspen ,2001," We sharpened our e-business focus by introducing our private marketplace solutions, Aspen Buy and Aspen Sell-. These products have been received enthusiastically by our customers and have expanded our capabilities to allow process manufacturers to purchase their direct materials and sell their products through privately branded marketplaces. The purchase of direct materials is often the largest operational cost for our customers and has a dramatic impact on the quality and profitability of their products. By integrating our marketplace solutions with our supply chain and manufacturing solutions, customers will be able to choose the best raw materials to optimize their profitability. Additionally, our Aspen Sell product will help process manufacturers improve responsiveness to client inquiries by creating better supply chain visibility with their long-term customers. "
Doc305,Aspen ,2001," On the financial front, we achieved record revenues of $310 million during fiscal 2001, driven by a 20 percent increase in services revenue and strong license revenue growth in the first half of the year. During the second half of the year, growth was slower for our license revenues due to the global economic slowdown. With our strategic position, we believe that we remain poised to return to a more robust level of growth once the economy stabilizes. "
Doc306,Aspen ,2001," We also saw a number of customers standardize on our technology, including an agreement with Rohm and Haas for our Plantelligence- and supply chain planning solutions, evidence that our integrated offerings continue to gain traction in the marketplace. We saw additional standardization decisions for various elements of our offering by Chevron, Dow, DuPont and Sinopec Corp. "
Doc307,Aspen ,2001," As we enter fiscal 2002, we are focused on execution and expanding the market penetration of our industry-leading solutions. Cur ability to provide value in real-time and link supply chain planning and execution activities will be important factors to our future success. "
Doc308,Aspen ,2001," AspenTech PetroVantage solution should gain significant momentum in the coming year, from its launch in the fall to generating meaningful revenues by year-end. Throughout fiscal 2002, we will be emphasizing Aspen ProfitAdvantage, demonstrating our ability to continue to provide the bottom-line improvements that gave us our start in 1981 and have kept us successful for the past 20 years. "
Doc309,Aspen ,2001," When the economy turns around, I have every confidence that we will resume attractive top-line and earnings growth. We are acknowledged as the leading technology provider and most innovative visionary in our market. Our customer satisfaction remains high, our market share continues to grow and our competitive position and management team have never been stronger. As we celebrate our 20th anniversary as a leading software provider to the process industries, I am excited by the unparalleled franchise we have put in place and our strong prospects for the future. "
Doc310,Aspen ,2001," I thank our employees, who have worked very hard during challenging times with loyalty and dedication, our customers who have worked closely with us with enthusiasm and understanding, and our shareholders who have supported us with confidence. We look forward to reporting our progress in the coming fiscal year. "
Doc311,Aspen ,2002,"Like many technology companies, AspenTech faced significant challenges during fiscal 2002, as the weak economic environment constrained demand and delayed customers?? purchasing decisions. As a result, our financial performance suffered and we reported disappointing revenue and bottom-line results for the year. "
Doc312,Aspen ,2002," In spite of these pressures, we have remained focused on refining our execution in all areas of our business. During the year we significantly strengthened our product offerings, broadened the value our solutions can deliver and improved the depth of our management team. "
Doc313,Aspen ,2002," Refined Strategy Based on Four Key Initiatives Against the backdrop of tough market conditions, we made several changes during the year to update our strategic direction and solidify our market leadership in the process industries. We believe these changes will serve as our foundation to expand market share and improve the company??s financial performance in the coming year. "
Doc314,Aspen ,2002," We articulated four strategic initiatives that we believe will not only return AspenTech to profitability as quickly as possible, but will streamline our selling process, improve the efficiency of our software development and services teams, and increase our market presence in key process industry segments beyond petroleum, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. "
Doc315,Aspen ,2002, [1] Organize the company around two product lines: Engineering and Manufacturing/Supply Chain 
Doc316,Aspen ,2002, We have dramatically simplified our organizational structure in order to more effectively align our internal resources with our sharpened emphasis and are focused on driving the performance of these two key product lines. 
Doc317,Aspen ,2002," We believe this new companywide alignment will lead to a clearer message to the market, as well as improve our execution and facilitate more predictable financial performance. By eliminating overlapping efforts and streamlining our product development, marketing and sales processes, we have created greater accountability throughout AspenTech. This structure is now fully in place and we are enthusiastic about the positive impact these changes will have on our productivity in the months and years ahead. "
Doc318,Aspen ,2002, [2] Complete the transformation of AspenTech into a provider of enterprise-wide Engineering and Manufacturing/Supply Chain solutions 
Doc319,Aspen ,2002," Our major global process industry customers are increasingly looking to partner with a few strategic software providers that can help them engineer and run their manufacturing and supply chain operations efficiently and profitably. To ensure that AspenTech cements its position as one of these core suppliers, our development efforts are focused on completing the transformation of our stand-alone point technologies into products that can be configured into scalable solutions deployed across the enterprise. "
Doc320,Aspen ,2002," To achieve this objective, we have restructured our software into three families: core technologies, or Foundation Products; pre-configured, industry Business Process Products; and Aspen Enterprise Platform?? products, which provide the basic infrastructure for integration and business process automation. All three families of products work together to deliver substantial economic value for our customers, integrating seamlessly with other components of the enterprise IT infrastructure and delivering a low cost of ownership. "
Doc321,Aspen ,2002, [3] Partner with select industry leaders to accelerate market penetration 
Doc322,Aspen ,2002," Delivering enterprise-wide solutions to our customers that are low risk and can be implemented quickly, requires that we establish partnerships with a few select companies. Companies such as Accenture, IBM Business Consulting Services (which includes the former operations of PwC Consulting) and Intergraph provide us with additional resources   in terms of technology, implementation expertise and industry knowledge to deploy compelling solutions for our global customers. "
Doc323,Aspen ,2002," Ultimately, these partnerships will result in increased revenues for AspenTech by helping us to deliver more value to our customers and expanding our available market. In fiscal 2002, the revenues we generated from partners were approximately 16 percent of our software revenues, up from 10 percent last year and on track to reach our stated goal of 20 percent or greater in fiscal 2003. "
Doc324,Aspen ,2002," [4] Maintain a vertical market focus, driving growth in Petroleum, Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals, and in key adjacent vertical markets "
Doc325,Aspen ,2002," While AspenTech??s traditional core markets of petroleum, chemicals and pharmaceuticals lie at the heart of our future growth plans, we are targeting other segments of the process market as areas of emerging growth for the company. These markets include the utilities, process-related consumer packaged goods (CPG) and oil & gas industries. The acquisition of Hyprotech supports this objective, diversifying AspenTech into a number of the most important process industry sectors where we did not have a strong presence previously. "
Doc326,Aspen ,2002," Strategic Acquisition of Hyprotech The acquisition of Hyprotech Ltd., a subsidiary of AEA Technology, was an important catalyst to the rollout of our refined strategy. The importance and relative strength of our combined engineering solutions were critical factors in our decision to acquire the company. While the timing of the purchase was not ideal given the marketplace volatility, Hyprotech??s five-year revenue growth of approximately 25 percent annually and its double-digit operating profits made the acquisition compelling for AspenTech, from both a financial and strategic perspective. "
Doc327,Aspen ,2002," Hyprotech is the leading supplier of engineering software to the refining and oil & gas industries and is a perfect complement to AspenTech, which has long been the leading supplier of engineering software to the petroleum, chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries. "
Doc328,Aspen ,2002," Based in Calgary, Canada, Hyprotech pioneered software that is used by engineers in a significant number of oil & gas production facilities and refineries. Hyprotech has a reputation for providing excellent, easy-to-use software and we anticipate its technologies will be an important component of our engineering software revenues this year. "
Doc329,Aspen ,2002," Relentless Focus on Execution Our plan to implement a flatter organizational structure, eliminate non-strategic projects and curtail spending has dramatically lowered the company??s quarterly breakeven point, while retaining our primary focus on the customer. Our success will require flawless execution throughout the year, both in terms of more predictable revenue streams and strict cost controls. One important change in company culture is the increased profit and loss responsibility that has been assigned to managers across the company. A significant portion of managers?? compensation will now be variable and based on our financial performance. This decision should improve our ability to achieve our growth and profitability objectives. "
Doc330,Aspen ,2002," Exceptional Market Positioning Ironically, in spite of difficult economic conditions that have limited our financial growth, our market position remains strong due to our relentless focus on our core strengths. AspenTech has meaningfully broadened its reach into new target markets and expanded its engineering expertise with the acquisition of Hyprotech. Software vendors that focus only on supply chain or process automation have struggled in the current economic environment because they lack the breadth required to deliver enterprise solutions. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) vendors remain a source of marketplace confusion. However, when customers compare our process industry knowledge with their lack of vertical focus, we remain the supplier of choice in the process industries. Our ability to retain and extend our market leadership in the face of an extremely challenging environment gives us confidence in our prospects for the future. "
Doc331,Aspen ,2002," Evolution in Leadership More than 20 years after the company was founded, the time had come to choose the next Chief Executive Officer of AspenTech. Our goal was to manage this transition in a way that respected the company??s roots in technical innovation and carefully considered the needs of our customers, employees, partners and shareholders. This process concluded last spring as the Board of Directors unanimously selected David McQuillin to lead the company. David joined AspenTech five years ago, strengthened our sales and marketing organization, and since November 2000 has served as co-chief operating officer. We worked closely together in refining the company??s strategic approach to the market and charting a course that will enable us to return to profitable operations and create a smooth transition of leadership as David takes the reins on October 1, 2002. "
Doc332,Aspen ,2002," David will be supported in his new role by Wayne Sim, the former CEO of Hyprotech, who joins our executive team as Senior Vice President of Sales. Wayne??s record in delivering sustained revenue and earnings growth at Hyprotech, his relationships with senior decision makers at our largest customers and his managerial acumen make him the ideal candidate to revitalize the performance of our sales organization. He is also one of AspenTech??s largest shareholders. "
Doc333,Aspen ,2002," Poised for Attractive Return on Investment We believe there has never been a time when the opportunity to deliver compelling solutions to our customers, generate significant financial returns and increase shareholder value has been so strong. Our solutions are addressing significant target markets, and with unchallenged technical superiority and a reputation for excellence that is unequalled in our industry, we believe we are poised to tap this opportunity. Customers earn returns on their investments in our solutions that are rapid and dramatic. Our unparalleled domain expertise and the proven performance of our solutions in some of the most complex environments are critical components to the value of the franchise we have built over two decades. More than 1,200 satisfied customers in 60 countries around the globe are a tribute to the commitment we place on delivering value and innovation. "
Doc334,Aspen ,2002," We thank our customers, partners, employees and shareholders for their loyalty and support over the past year. As the new leadership team takes over, we look forward to reporting new accomplishments for our company in the coming fiscal year. "
Doc335,Aspen ,2003,"Fiscal 2003 was a year of transition and significant progress for AspenTech. Despite the challenges of an anemic economy and a stagnant IT spending environment, the company met or exceeded its operational and financial objectives for the last three quarters of the fiscal year. These profitable results were the culmination of several decisive actions, which included reorganizing the company around our Engineering and Manufacturing/Supply Chain product lines, strengthening the management team, dramatically reducing operating expenses, and improving execution across the company. "
Doc336,Aspen ,2003," By taking these actions and dramatically improving our operating performance, the company was able to take an important step forward with the restructuring of our balance sheet. In August 2003, we closed a $100 million private equity transaction with Advent International, which eliminated nearterm debt obligations, bolstered working capital, and put the company in a solid financial position to fuel top-line and bottom-line growth. "
Doc337,Aspen ,2003," With these changes, AspenTech enters fiscal 2004 with an improved and sustainable operating model, an excellent market position, and the financial resources to improve shareholder value by delivering valuable, differentiated solutions to our customers. "
Doc338,Aspen ,2003," Updated Strategic Direction We began the fiscal year by showcasing our newest solutions at AspenWorld, the biennial conference for process industry executives that attracts more than 2,000 participants. These solutions address the emerging Enterprise Operations Management (EOM) market and are designed to increase the profitability of our process industry customers by improving their operational efficiency and flexibility. As a first mover in the EOM market, AspenTech is establishing a leadership position. Our new EOM solutions have been extremely well received by customers and have already delivered significant economic benefits to several early adopters that have completed implementations.We believe the next wave of IT spending in the process industries will be focused on improving operational performance and that AspenTech is well positioned as the EOM market grows. "
Doc339,Aspen ,2003," Improved Operational Performance In October 2002, we reduced our expenses by approximately twenty-five percent to deal with the challenges of a weak IT spending environment. These reductions, together with improved productivity and execution across the company, enabled us to stabilize the business and sequentially grow pro forma earnings per share each of the last three quarters of the fiscal year. "
Doc340,Aspen ,2003," One of the key drivers of this improved performance was the solid performance of the Engineering product line, which exceeded our targets for the year and enabled the company to surpass our expectations for software revenue. These products performed well because they help customers improve their operating margins and capital efficiency even during industry and economic downturns. The addition of the heritage Hyprotech products also allowed us to establish a more significant presence in two major markets: petroleum refining, and upstream oil & gas. "
Doc341,Aspen ,2003," While the performance of our Manufacturing/ Supply Chain product line was not as robust as we had hoped, we are excited about the growth potential of several new products we developed during the year, including three we jointly developed with Accenture. One of these products, Aspen Enterprise Platform (AEP), a robust openintegration infrastructure and a key component of our Operations Cockpit, has been sold to fourteen customers and deployed in more than eighty plants in just the ten months since its commercial launch. Overall, we saw improved demand for our Manufacturing/Supply Chain solutions in our fourth quarter and are excited about our sales pipeline as the economy improves and our customers return to making strategic IT investments. "
Doc342,Aspen ,2003," From an end-user standpoint, customers in the upstream oil & gas, petroleum refining, chemicals, polymers, engineering & construction, and pharmaceutical industries comprised the largest segments of our business in fiscal 2003.We will continue to focus on these industries as the source of our most significant opportunities and the main drivers of our future growth by developing targeted, scalable EOM solutions for each of these major vertical industries. "
Doc343,Aspen ,2003," Strengthened Balance Sheet In August 2003, the company restructured its balance sheet and significantly added to its cash balances by completing a $100 million private equity financing with Advent International. This transaction, although dilutive to common shareholders, addressed several near-term debt obligations and put the company back in a stable financial situation. Additionally, the confidence of Advent to make such a significant investment was an important validation of the value of AspenTech??s franchise and market opportunity. "
Doc344,Aspen ,2003," Another reason this capital investment was so critical to the company was that shortly after the fiscal year ended, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) decided to challenge our acquisition of Hyprotech Ltd. The company??s improved financial position will enable us to mount a vigorous defense to this challenge. AspenTech does not agree with the FTC??s assertion that the transaction was anticompetitive or with its interpretation of the facts.We believe that the acquisition benefits customers and has enabled us to accelerate innovation in the marketplace. "
Doc345,Aspen ,2003," The company has accrued for the expenses relating to this challenge, which may take as long as three to five years to complete if all appeals are taken. In the meantime, we have the resources to defend against these allegations. In the interim, the litigation will not impact our commitment to our customers, and we will continue to deliver innovative, high-value engineering solutions. "
Doc346,Aspen ,2003," Positioned for Profitable Growth The improvement in our operating performance, our strengthened balance sheet and the tremendous value of our customer franchise give me a high level of confidence as we begin our new fiscal year. AspenTech enters fiscal 2004 very well positioned, with a set of solutions that deliver rapid, substantial returns to customers facing significant pressures on their operating performance every day. "
Doc347,Aspen ,2003," As we leverage the strength of our latest product offering, we will continue to focus on generating positive cash flow to build on our improved financial position.With more than seventy-five percent of our software revenues coming from recurring term licenses and with a significantly lowered break-even point, we believe we have dramatically increased the visibility and predictability of our business model. "
Doc348,Aspen ,2003," The executive management team has come together nicely, with the most recent addition being Chuck Kane, who joined the company as Chief Financial Officer at the start of fiscal 2004. The entire team is energized by the progress the company has made and is committed to generating profitable growth in the year ahead. "
Doc349,Aspen ,2003," As I close out my first year as CEO, I would like to recognize the loyalty of our customers and partners, and thank our employees for their dedication over what was a very challenging period. The progress we made over the past year would not have been possible without their support and encouragement.With the solid foundation we established in fiscal 2003, the groundwork has been laid for AspenTech to return to attractive financial and operational performance in the year ahead. "
Doc350,Aspen ,2004,"I am pleased to write this letter to you as the new President and CEO of AspenTech. Approximately four months have passed since I took over the leadership of the Company, and I have a great deal to share with you about what has happened at AspenTech and how we are positioning the Company to move forward successfully. "
Doc351,Aspen ,2004," On March 15, 2005, AspenTech concluded a very difficult period in its history by completing a financial investigation into certain software license and service transactions that were entered into during the past five fiscal years. The investigation caused the Company to delay its shareholder meeting and the filing of its financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission until the Audit Committee had finished its review. The financial impact shown by the restated financials was that revenues in fiscal years 1999-2001 decreased by approximately $27 million and that revenues for the past three fiscal years, 2002-2004 increased by approximately $33 million. Most important, we have taken steps to improve our financial controls and change revenue recognition policies for software license transactions with resellers in order to rectify the problems that led to this restatement. "
Doc352,Aspen ,2004," In December, the Company also disclosed that it had finalized its settlement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) concerning the Company's 2002 acquisition of Hyprotech, Ltd. We are pleased with the terms of this settlement, and it will free up a significant amount of management bandwidth so that we can focus on improving our operational performance. We believe that this settlement will also remove uncertainties for customers and prospects about our product road maps and our plans for customer support. They will now be able to evaluate and purchase our technology solely on the basis of the clear value that our solutions provide. "
Doc353,Aspen ,2004," Finally, we have made a number of important changes to our executive management team to improve our execution in the future. We have hired a new head of marketing and a new head of human resources; and we have appointed a new head of worldwide services, as well as a new head of worldwide sales. We have also added executive resources and expertise for our business in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. "
Doc354,Aspen ,2004," With a new team in place and the resolution of significant operating and financial challenges, I believe that AspenTech is essentially starting fresh. We are now free to devote our full attention to executing the Company's business strategy and better serving our customers, ensuring that we maximize the Company's long term value for all stakeholders. "
Doc355,Aspen ,2004," Fiscal 2004 Performance Although we did not generate the level of profitability that we were striving to attain, the results from Fiscal 2004 were a step in the right direction. This financial improvement has put AspenTech in a stronger position to sell strategically to our largest customers. Our stronger financial foundation will enable them to invest in our solutions for the long term with confidence. "
Doc356,Aspen ,2004, AspenTech restored its financial viability and significantly improved its financial position in Fiscal 2004 by paying off approximately $99 million of financial obligations and increasing its cash balance by approximately $56 million. 
Doc357,Aspen ,2004," The most significant development during Fiscal 2004 was the strengthening of AspenTech's balance sheet, which improved the Company's financial stability and viability. In addition to raising $100 million through a preferred stock financing with Advent International at the beginning of the fiscal year, the Company also generated more than $40 million in cash flow from operations. This cash infusion enabled AspenTech to eliminate a significant portion of its financial obligations, while still increasing its overall cash balance. Today, our remaining long term debt consists primarily of $57 million of subordinated debentures, which will mature on June 15, 2005. "
Doc358,Aspen ,2004," A stronger balance sheet, combined with the ability to generate predictable cash flows, enables us to better manage our business - both in the short and in the long term. As we move forward, our goal is to deliver profitable operational results that will rank us in the top quartile of the software industry. "
Doc359,Aspen ,2004," Helping Our Customers Achieve Operational Excellence For more than 23 years, AspenTech's focus has been applying process engineering expertise to develop and deliver software solutions and services that address the fundamental operational problems of the process industries. Today, our customers face new pressures to improve operational and financial performance while simultaneously managing a more complicated and interdependent set of demands than ever before. These challenges include the following: More complex global operations An increasing list of global competitors High raw material and energy costs Tighter environmental regulations An expanding number of disparate IT applications and legacy systems "
Doc360,Aspen ,2004," The need to continue to grow profits in such a complex environment is fueling an industry-wide focus on process operations - the business processes, technology, and physical assets involved in procuring raw materials, manufacturing products, and distributing these products to end users. In fact, most leading process manufacturers have already launched strategic initiatives centered on improving overall operational excellence. "
Doc361,Aspen ,2004," At the heart of operational excellence is the ability for operations personnel in a process company to make decisions that are Real-time Driven by customer demand Responsive to opportunities or disruptions as they occur Coordinated and synchronized across functional departments, regions, and businesses "
Doc362,Aspen ,2004," Making these decisions in the process industries, however, is difficult because of the complex, interdependent, and real-time nature of the business processes that comprise the enterprise. In today's environment, these challenges are even more complicated: plants must synchronize their activities with the rest of the supply chain; work processes must span many departments; and people must collaborate across the global organization-all using the same consistent, accurate, and up-to-date operations information, models, and assumptions. "
Doc363,Aspen ,2004," For process manufacturers, these requirements mean that a new wave of IT investments in operations must be made, much the same way that investments in distributed control systems (DCS) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems became essential in earlier decades. To help develop and implement IT strategies for achieving operational excellence, process manufacturers are looking to AspenTech. "
Doc364,Aspen ,2004," Historically, AspenTech has addressed the complex challenges of the process industries with point solutions or standalone applications designed to solve specific problems. We are, in fact, the industry standard and market leader in providing many of the software applications that the process industries depend on today-Aspen HYSYS?? and Aspen Plus for process simulation and optimization, and Aspen PIMS for advanced planning and scheduling, to name a few of our many products. "
Doc365,Aspen ,2004," To meet the challenges of integrated operations, companies must have more than a disparate system of point solutions and standalone applications that currently exist. They must be able to respond to rapidly changing economic conditions, customer demand, and environmental regulations as they occur. To do so, process manufacturers require an integrated set of capabilities-organized along their specific business processes in their respective verticals. "
Doc366,Aspen ,2004," Driving Growth with integrated Solutions: aspenONE The cornerstone of AspenTech's strategy is to integrate our industry-leading point solutions along our customers' vertical industries and business processes into scalable modules that facilitate real-time decision making across the enterprise. The initial culmination of this effort was the first release of aspenONE in October 2004. aspenONE is a unified offering of software solutions, professional services, and industry partnerships geared specifically for key process industry vertical segments such as oil & gas, petroleum, and chemicals. "
Doc367,Aspen ,2004, aspenONE fundamentally changes the game for the process industries. It provides a foundation for innovation and growth by improving the efficiency of business processes through real-time decision making and offering a comprehensive system to manage and optimize operational performance. 
Doc368,Aspen ,2004," Because the challenges and opportunities in achieving operational excellence are inherently specific to each vertical industry, aspenONE is designed to meet the distinctive demands of each market. aspenONE solutions help process manufacturers address the business processes that have the greatest impact on financial performance by providing a tailored set of capabilities that have never been available before: A unified view of manufacturing and supply chain information An ability to synchronize manufacturing plans with supply chain processes based on accurate insight into plant capabilities An ability to detect and respond to unanticipated manufacturing and supply chain problems and opportunities An ability to monitor and analyze operational performance, conduct root cause analysis, and leverage models to facilitate optimal decision making "
Doc369,Aspen ,2004," Using aspenONE, process companies are able to make operational decisions based on profitability rather than expediency. They can identify profit opportunities and, quite literally for the first time, manage their operations rather than simply react to problems. "
Doc370,Aspen ,2004," AspenTech's long history of working with our customers to understand and solve the complexities of the process industries has consistently made us a leader in bringing technology innovations to the market. With the launch of aspenONE, we are continuing this tradition of recognizing market opportunities, partnering with our customers to understand their challenges, and developing and delivering compelling solutions to serve those markets. "
Doc371,Aspen ,2004," We have invested a significant amount of development resources in aspenONE, and we are optimistic about its ability to help the Company drive top-line growth in the coming years. "
Doc372,Aspen ,2004, aspenONE is the first ever unified release of the broad portfolio of AspenTech products and represents a major commitment to delivering tightly integrated operations solutions to the process industries. 
Doc373,Aspen ,2004," Near-term Initiatives I have spent the past four months analyzing AspenTech's organizational structure, business processes, and product strategy and portfolio. I have also spent considerable time meeting with our customers, partners, and employees in every geographic region. It is clear that AspenTech has tremendous assets, but I believe we can do a much better job in leveraging these assets to create greater value for all stakeholders. "
Doc374,Aspen ,2004," To that end, I have established the following initiatives to improve our performance: Improve our business execution to drive growth and profitability. The Company's operational performance over the past five years has been inconsistent, and we have not generated acceptable levels of profitability and cash flow. We need to improve our execution across all segments of the business. Specifically, we need to do a better job of organizing the Company around key vertical markets, which will enable us to improve the way we develop, market, and sell our products. This is fundamental to making AspenTech a well-run, profitable Company for the long term, and is critical to improving our financial results and returning to healthy top-line growth. "
Doc375,Aspen ,2004," Deliver our integrated aspenONE solutions for the chemical and petroleum markets. I want to reassure our customers, our employees, and our investors that we are committed to delivering our aspenONE solutions. The Company took a major step forward in 2004, with the first release of aspenONE, by simplifying the product offering from more than 200 point products to six major industry solutions. We currently have solutions that are enterprise-ready, but by helping process manufacturers integrate their zpplications and unlock new value, we can expand our presence in the marketplace. We will continue to integrate our solutions and deliver important new innovations to help our customers improve their operational performance. "
Doc376,Aspen ,2004," Continued improvement of our balance sheet. We reduced the Company's financial obligations by more than $98 million during 2004. Over the past two and a half years, we spent nearly $30 million of cash on legal and accounting expenses, relating primarily to our FTC proceeding and the recently completed Audit Committee investigation. Our commitment to continue to upgrade our balance sheet will be driven by our ability to generate positive free cash flow in the future. Now that we will not need to use cash on one-time legal and accounting expenses, we can use the Company's free cash flow to add to our cash balances and further invest in our business. "
Doc377,Aspen ,2004," Exceed the expectations of all our key stakeholders. The Company has faced numerous challenges over the past three years. With these challenges behind us, we need to move forward in a positive direction, working hand in hand with all stakeholders. We need to achieve a high level of transparency and accountability, adhering to the highest ethical standards. I am focused on building a stronger Company that will consistently meet the highest expectations of our customers, employees, and investors. Establishing this credibility will be a critical component of enabling us to deliver against our strategic plan. "
Doc378,Aspen ,2004," I feel very good about the opportunities in front of AspenTech, and I am confident about our chances to succeed. I base this confidence on the fact that we have faced significant hurdles over the past three years, amidst a challenging IT spending environment. Despite these challenges, AspenTech has overcome significant obstacles and is well positioned for the future. We have more than 20 years of domain expertise; the best products; a differentiated, customer-centric vision for optimizing the operations of process manufacturers; and a large, loyal customer base in all process sectors. "
Doc379,Aspen ,2004," We are starting a new chapter for AspenTech, and I am excited to lead this transition. I would like to thank our employees and our customers for their continuing loyalty to AspenTech. I expect to interact with all our stakeholders more frequently in the coming year. I am enthusiastic about the future and look forward to reporting on our progress and realizing the strategic vision for AspenTech. "
Doc380,Astea ,1996,"The year 1996 was one of positioning and investment for Astea. Although our earnings performance was a disappointment. we believe that our merger with Bendata. Inc. and acquisition of Abalon AB coupled with our investment in product development, technology, and infrastructure will begin to clearly differentiate us from our competition in the Customer interaction Software marketplace. In 1997 we intend to continue to make the necessary investments while at the same time improving efficiencies and reducing unnecessary expenses. "
Doc381,Astea ,1996," We are always urging our customers to invest in their support organizations  in any competitive industry. it is support that often creates a competitive advantage. Astea has built its reputation on providing one of the most complete, feature-rich field service automation solutions on the market today. DISPATCH. in addition to DISPATCH over the past year we have significantly expanded our product line to help companies improve other facets of their interaction with customers - from increasing sales success rates to responding to customer questions and problems. The power of our systems is enormous. "
Doc382,Astea ,1996," Customer interaction solutions are key to identifying, winning, and keeping customers. They are key to creating differentiation and customer loyalty in highly competitive markets. The information from customer interaction systems is also key in making decisions about reengineering business processes to increase efficiency and improve profitability. "
Doc383,Astea ,1996," Today. Astea is one of the few companies that offers a family of products that supports the full customer interaction cycle. We are also one of the largest vendors of customer interaction systems worldwide, with a total installed base of over 2,700 customers and 75.000 end users. "
Doc384,Astea ,1996," Astea's revenues increased 16 percent to $62.7 million in 1996 from $54.0 million in 1995. While we did experience significant growth in our help desk and sales and marketing automation product lines. we were faced with increased competition and longer sales cycles with our flagship DISPATCH product. Astea??s pro forma net loss of $2.8 million, or $.22 per share. tor the year ended December 31. 19%, represented a decrease from proforma net income of $5.2 million, or $.45 per share, during I995. The Company's $2.8 million proforma net loss for 19%, which excludes the one time charges relat- ed to the Bendata, Inc. merger and Abalon AB acquisition. was also marked by substantial investment in the operations of the Company that we hope will better position us for the future. "
Doc385,Astea ,1996, Our largest investments In the past year were the merger with Bendata. inc. in February and the acquisition of Abalon AB in June. The Bendata. inc. merger is strategically important because it gave us one of the most complete and robust help desk solutions in the marketplace. Help Desk automation software is becoming a vital part of the customer interaction cycle. it is the first line of defense in solving customer problems quickly and satisfactorily while reducing a company's overall support costs. 
Doc386,Astea ,1996, Adding Bendata's HEAT help desk solutions to our existing high-end PowerHelp help desk solution also enables us to move beyond our traditional Fortune 1000 customer base and reach an even broader market with our full product portfolio. 
Doc387,Astea ,1996, Through the Abalon AB acquisition we are now able to offer companies a system that helps them improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their marketing and sales processes. Based in Sweden. Abalon AB has dominated the Scandinavian marketplace for nearly a decade. Like Astea's DISPATCH service automation system and Bendata's HEAT help desk solution. Abalon AB??s sales and marketing automation product is one of the best offerings of any solution in its class. it is one of the only products on the market capable of supporting the complex. team-oriented selling processes of the Fortune 1000 companies that are the core of Astea's installed base. 
Doc388,Astea ,1996," Astea's powerful products for the customer interaction software market are deployed around the world. in 1996 we began the engineering efforts to provide the common components required to make our enterprise otterlng more scalable and integrated. capitatizing on state-of-the-art tools such as distributed objects. Java. and the lnternet. The links we are creating between products will give our customers tremendous opportunities to share information, improve operating efficiencies, and empower the employees who interact with their customers. "
Doc389,Astea ,1996," In 1996 we had major product releases in each of our product lines DiSPATCH, HEAT and Abaion. These releases brought significant product enhancements driven by our customers and the market. with perhaps the most significant and exciting new features allowing certain products to become Web enabled. The Internet/intranet is undoubtedly the business and technical phenomenon of this century. and all of our customers are looking at ways to exploit this power to provide better service to their customers. "
Doc390,Astea ,1996," in 1996 we responded to this market requirement with innovative capabilities such as the ability to provide access over the Internet to DlSPATCH's core service functions. including work order management, parts order management, and depot repair. We also announced HEATLink which lets customers or authorized deaiers check the status of their service requests directly over the internet. This can significantly reduce the call volume and resources required for a customer support operation. "
Doc391,Astea ,1996," In 1996 we also made substantial investments in our distribution channels, particuiorly in international markets. We signed up five new value-added resellers in Australia. the Philippines, Taiwan. Indonesia.and Malaysia. "
Doc392,Astea ,1996, We concluded an exclusive international distribution agreement with Japanese conglomerate Nlssho iwai Corporation. one of the ten largest companies in the world. to develop. distribute. and sell a Japanese language version of our help desk software. 
Doc393,Astea ,1996," One of the great strengths of our recent merger and acquisition is the opportunity to cross-sell products among the Astea, Bendata. inc. and Abalon AB customer bases. We are also achieving important success in key vertical markets where customer interaction solutions are rapidly becoming mission-critical applications. in 1997 we will bring all of our resources to bear on exceeding our customers?? expectations tor superior products and support. At the heart of this effort, as always, are our employees. No company has gathered together more expetise and experience in customer interaction software. and no group of employees has shown more dedication and passion for applying that expertise to solving real customer problems. With the commitment of our employees and the support of our shareholders. I am looking forward to a successful year. "
Doc394,Astea ,1997,"The year 1997 was one of getting back to fundamentals, solidifying Astea??s leadership position and extend- ing our reach in the customer service market. At the same time we have been building a foundation to compete more effectively across the spectrum of Technology Enabled Relationship Management (TERM) software products. "
Doc395,Astea ,1997," During the year we continued to see the effect of our first quarter 1997 restructuring and other cost containment programs. By working diligently, we were able to produce a modest fourth-quarter profit. This occurred with only limited contribution from new products, which are in the early stages of roll out. Currently, Astea is between product cyclcs. The Company is transitioning from its legacy technologies to new client/server and component architectures to support our current and future customers. We expect license revenues from our new product offerings and technologies to grow in the future to begin another cycle of growth and profits. "
Doc396,Astea ,1997," BUILDING ON A STRONG FOUNDATION During 1997 such leading companies as Bay Networks. GTE, Croupe Bull, NCR, Sprint, Storage Tek and Sun Microsystems moved into production or expanded their environments with Astea products. Astea customers are at the heart of the Company??s success, with our corporate customer base representing approximately 4,000 companies with over 90,000 end users. "
Doc397,Astea ,1997," These customers, like others in the global arena, are all facing competitive challenges where customer loyalty is regarded as the key to success. Companies are being asked not only to service the increasing demands of their customers, but to do so more rapidly and over a broader time frame with greater coverage - both nationally and internationally. Companies are seeking ways to leverage the latest technologies of computers, communications and the Internet. "
Doc398,Astea ,1997," Unlike many of our competitors?? solutions, Astea??s solutions do more than problem resolution; our customers rely on them to support the entire lifecycle of their customer interactions. Astea??s strong support of business logistics enables our customers to enjoy return on investment, allowing customer care organizations to move from being cost centers to profit centers as strategic lines of business. "
Doc399,Astea ,1997," SPANNING THE CUSTOMER SERVICE MARKET During 1997, we have broadened the potential market for our customer services products beyond our traditional enterprise customers. Astea introduced two new customer service product offerings positioned for large revenue opportunity for the mid-market and smaller enterprises. We believe that our ServiceAllianceIM and Virtual Service Corporationm (VSC) offerings dramatically reduce implementation complexity using client/server and web technologies. Astea now offers a full spectrum of customer service products and services. "
Doc400,Astea ,1997," In the 3rd quarter we announced ServiceAlliance, Astea??s new client/server based field service management software solution, which draws on the best practices and functionality of Astea??s DISPATCH-1, the industry??s most comprehensive customer service application. We are gratified by the market acceptance of ServiceAlliance, which is being implemented in businesses worldwide. Mid-sized companies can now capitalize on our tremendous knowledge of the service industry. And ServiceAlliance provides a fast return on investment, being less complex, easily customizable and quicker to install. Incorporating an integrated set of modules and interfacing to a wide range of popular database products, ServiceAlliance incorporates a ??virtual front office?? that provides a universal view of all customer activities. "
Doc401,Astea ,1997," In the 4th quarter, building on recent trends towards increased use of corporate outsourcing, Astea announced the formation of a new subsidiary called Virtual Service Corporation in collaboration with Mitsubishi Electronics America. VSC provides for the full deployment of DISPATCH-1 via the Internet, on a highly secure, time share basis. VSC will provide online access to the software and each customer's database for a monthly service fee. This is in direct contrast to the traditional approach, which requires the customer to make investments in the purchase of hardware, software, and networking. Thus, Astea has taken down the barriers for many companies to use an automated customer service system. VSC supports thin clients, Personal Digital Assistants and the latest smart phones. Mitsubishi??s technology, financial clout and substantial presence in industrial and technology firms both large and small worldwide should contribute to the success of this offering. "
Doc402,Astea ,1997," BENEFITING FROM A COMPLETE SOLUTION Astea is continuing with our goal of building an end-to-end customer management solution extending our domain from customer service to customer support and sales and marketing. During 1997, Astea built on its 1996 acquisitions of Bendata's HEAT, an internal help desk product, and Abalon, a sales, marketing and customer care solution, by expanding their product offerings and markets. "
Doc403,Astea ,1997," The Abalon products distribution was expanded from Scandinavia into the rest of Europe, the United States and the Pacific rim. The newest release, Version 3.8 of Aloalon, supports the growing use of web-ased intranets, the Java platform, UNIX and Windows 95 and NT. Abalon has developed capability to address vertical markets including insurance, telecommunications and utilities. For example, Abalon's telecom partner, TP DEC Systems, Limited, in Hong Kong, helped Astea close three contracts in the Pacific rim. In Europe, Sun Microsystems chose Abalon to create a single pan-European solution for its telephone-based sales operations. In the United States we have made a number of Abalon sales, including Savin Corporation. "
Doc404,Astea ,1997," Bendata's HEAT product line continues to be a leader in the internal help desk market. The latest HEAT version 3.6, sets a new standard for support center problem solving and automated call logging and tracking. Other HEAT products link to the Internet and offer telephony integration. The company announced HEAT Work Group Asset manager that lets users monitor product life cycles and reduce the total cost of ownership. Bendata also announced the signature series product, a collaborative effort to develop the first set of integrated tools for help desk managers. Corporate participants include Oracle, US West, Digital equipment, the gartner group and the meta group. "
Doc405,Astea ,1997," Investing in R&D and the future Astea is making significant investments to develop new technologies for our next generation of products that can sustain our competitive market position into the next century. Starting from a strong base in service and adding our 1996 acquisitions in customer support and sales and marketing, we are working to consolidate our position. One strength of Astea is our customer base, and we will provide a clear migration path for our customers. "
Doc406,Astea ,1997, Our goal is to deliver a complete Enterprise level technology enabled relationship management (term) solution that is as comprehensive as our individual current products. The technology will be developed from pre-built components that can be implemented in steps. 
Doc407,Astea ,1997," Unlike others who market relationship management software, Astea already enjoys a strong global presence with international business already accounting for one-third of our sales. By thinking globally, we plan to build on our international advantage by supporting our many global customers as they expand their systems. "
Doc408,Astea ,1997," restructuring to meet new challenges One of the important additions to our team is Jake LaMotta, who has joined use as president & coo. Jake represents the continuation of our restructuring to move toward a more accountable and effective organization. He has a track record of managing fast growth companies. Mr. LaMotta brings over 30 years of software and computer systems industry experience to Astea, having held positions such as President, CEO and senior sales and marketing positions at large, public, private and international companies. His broad range of software services and outsourcing expertise spans both private and public sectors. We are delighted to have Jake on board. "
Doc409,Astea ,1997," Utilizing our recent acquisitions and new product initiatives, Astea is in a better position to focus on license growth. Focusing on both - cross-selling within what is the largest customer base in the industry and mid-tier companies with their shorter sales cycles - should give us better revenue predictability and broaden our customer base. "
Doc410,Astea ,1997," In these challenging times, I am always encouraged by the ongoing commitments of our customers and employees. No group has gathered together more expertise and experience in customer relationship management software, and no group has shown more dedication and passion for applying that expertise to solving real customer problems. Although faced with challenges, Astea is well positioned to take advantage of its industry presence and to expand on its leadership in our core markets. "
Doc411,Astea ,1998,"1998 was a year of transition  for both Astea and the marketplace. The customer service market, now more commonly known as Customer Relationship Management (CRM), quickened its evolutionary pace. Once considered to be on the periphery of information technology disciplines, CRM is now widely regarded as a core business requirement and has started an ascent to the top of corporate priority lists. CRM market opportunities abound, because more and more companies find it increasingly difficult to compete on traditional price/performance paradigms. "
Doc412,Astea ,1998," Customer service is pulling ahead as the major marketing differentiator for leading providers of goods and services. Additionally, new competitive industries brought about by deregulation, such as telecommunications in the United States and Europe, further expand the market for CRM products and services. "
Doc413,Astea ,1998," Given this backdrop, Astea made significant and widespread changes to realign its direction and market strategy to core competencies. We are convinced that the changes made will benefit our stockholders, employees and clients. "
Doc414,Astea ,1998," A STRONGER MARKET FOCUS The addition of Jake LaMotta as Astea's President and COO in early 1998 launched the process of revitalizing our corporate direction and strategy. New senior sales and marketing executives soon followed. The result is an energetic, experienced team of professionals, committed to reshaping Astea's future and to ensuring that the Company moves forward as a preeminent player in a highly competitive marketplace. With the reorganization of our management team came a careful and considered evaluation of the Company's strategic market position. it became clear that our past acquisitions, although fundamentally strong companies, did not contribute to a strong market focus and that the expected synergies would not materialize. To ensure Astea's long-term success, our market focus must be clear, distinct, and concerted, and it should leverage the Company's inherent industry expertise and knowledge. "
Doc415,Astea ,1998," Accordingly, we initiated and completed the divestiture of our Bendata, lnc. and Abalon AB business units, which added over $50 million (before taxes) in additional cash reserves to our balance sheet in 1998. From a management perspective, these actions simplify our organization and culture, eliminating the management distractions that typically occur when markets and products are too dissimilar. We have now consolidated our resources on the development of leading-edge CRM solutions for organizations where field service and customer support are heavily weighted in the business model. The brunt of our development, sales, and marketing efforts can now be brought to bear on Astea??s flagship service-related CRM product suites, ServiceAlliance and DISPATCH-1, These types of customer-focused service applications represent the historic strength and expertise of Astea as well as its strongest market position. "
Doc416,Astea ,1998," INVESTING IN ASTEA'S FUTURE Leveraging that position will require careful planning and investment, Beginning in 1998 and continuing into 1999, Astea has been aggressively emphasizing a broad spectrum of sales and marketing efforts to take advantage of product licensing opportunities in the CRM market space, which are increasing dramatically. Examples of this investment include the hiring of senior sales and marketing executives, the opening of six new regional sales offices throughout the United States, and the 100% expansion of our US sales force since May of 1998. ln addition to aggressive efforts to develop both direct and indirect US distribution channels, we have also expanded our European, Asian, and South African market presence via new ServiceAlliance distributors, and increased direct sales presence in both the United Kingdom and France. "
Doc417,Astea ,1998," This investment will be critical in ensuring that Astea??s message is clearly communicated over the din of the many newcomers that would like to penetrate our market. For example, our experience and research indicate a strong preference across the various industries that we serve to implement solutions tailored to their specific needs and environments. We believe that ServiceAlliance's inherent and highly advanced capabilities to customize applications without source code modification provide a strong basis upon which to build a vertically merchandised product and marketing strategy. "
Doc418,Astea ,1998," A number of other key decisions and actions of the past year have helped to establish a new foundation upon which Astea enters1999. The keystone in that foundation is a marquee customer base. From it, Astea draws its unique depth of expertise in developing and implementing service solutions across a variety of industries and countries. Our customer roster includes such global industry leaders as Storage Technology, Sprint, NCR, Groupe Bull, Johnson Controls, Associated Press, GTE, and approximately 400 other world-class companies in the United States, Scandinavia, continental Europe, the United Kingdom, and the Pacific Rim. Astea's customers are a source of strength and stability, and in 1998 we recommitted the company to a superior level of customer service. We have put in place the necessary organization, tools, and measurements to ensure that our clients enjoy solid and dependable service. Recurring revenues from those professional service operations continue to play an important role in Astea's business outlook. They account for a significant share of 1998 revenues and provide financial stability as we transition the company's flagship DISPATCH-1 product over the next several years to ServiceAlliance. "
Doc419,Astea ,1998," THE FUTURE IS SERVICEALLIANCE Our decision to make the transition from DISPATCH-1 to ServiceAlliance came in response to a number of industry-wide shifts in market dynamics and technology. To remain competitive, today's businesses require tighter integration - both within their front-office applications and between other key business systems. The need for faster and simpler implementations requires the continued explosion of demand for Internet related capabilities are driving faster product development cycles. Multinational operational demands are now commonplace, creating the need for multilingual, multiple currency applications. in Europe, for example, it will take several years to complete the transition to the euro. With its adaptability, ease-of-use, and shortened implementation cycle, ServiceAlliance is designed for appeal in precisely this kind of business environment. The product's open architectural design, configurability, and Web capabilities allow it to span a much broader market segment-appealing to a variety of organizational sizes from the mid to high tiers. Available in English, French, and Japanese (Kanji), the Product also has international appeal. "
Doc420,Astea ,1998," CRM or ??front-office software applications help an organization improve its customer interaction over the entire customer life cycle, improving service quality and service levels, while reducing the cost of delivering customer service. In 1999, ServiceAlliance will continue to evolve within the CRM model, emphasizing a complete front-office solution. It will support the entire customer life cycle, from sales automation to customer support and service for organizations where customer field service is a mission-critical activity. As we build the migration plans and tools required to ensure a smooth transition to ServiceAlliance, we will continue to take the steps necessary to support our DISPATCH account base. The knowledge, experience, and support of that broad customer base will play a vital role in defining the vision and requirements for an evolving ServiceAlliance. "
Doc421,Astea ,1998," Above all, we are fully committed to returning Astea to profitability through superior products and services. While we will continue to invest in sales, marketing and other areas necessary to maintain a strong market position, we are extremely cost-conscious, and all such investments will be carefully scrutinized, The lnitial market reaction to ServiceAlliance has been extremely positive, and we are convinced that with successful products and the new cash resources to back them, we will see positive results from our new direction in 1999. "
Doc422,Astea ,1998," 1998 was a challenging year for Astea, but one filled with the promise of new beginnings that only such dramatic change can imbue. We have put into place the people, the resources, and the products to drive Astea to a new, successful and profitable year in 1999. We thank our customers, employees and shareholders for their continuing support. "
Doc423,Astea ,2001,"In 2001, Astea achieved many milestones that will secure a future of sustainable growth in revenue, profitability and shareholder value: "
Doc424,Astea ,2001," Revenues from our AllianceEnterprise Suite software licensing and maintenance increased 72% and 77%, respectively. A 29% reduction in operating costs lowered the Company's run rate to a level that will enable any increases in software sales in 2002 to fall directly to the bottom line. Continuing investments in new product development were unaffected by our cost control measures and strengthened the Company's market positioning moving forward. Astea's balance sheet continues to be strong with cash and investments on hand totaling $7.1 million or $0.48 per share. "
Doc425,Astea ,2001," New AllianceEnterprise sales were characterized by expanded system configurations for higher enduser solutions due, in part, to new applications for clients' mobile sales and service employees. New additions to the AllianceEnterprise customer base included marquee companies such as Citibank, Cummins-Allison, Fujifilm, Fujitsu (ICL), Gretag, Inova Health System, Mettler-Toledo, and many others. Existing Astea users like Johnson Controls, Toshiba Electronic Imaging, Panaseer and Systech Retail Systems commenced upgrading and expanding their systems with our latest applications. "
Doc426,Astea ,2001," Several showcase installations went live in 2001: Kunick Leisure, an amusement and gaming company in the United Kingdom, was the first client to have smart machines issue service requests directly to the AllianceEnterprise system. Japan Business Computer Co., whose largest shareholder is IBM Japan, deployed AllianceEnterprise with NTT DoCoMo's iMode cell phone Internet service in the first integration of continuously online wireless Internet with an enterprise management solution. "
Doc427,Astea ,2001," AllianceEnterprise today is being built with Microsoft NET technologies, which heralds a new and exciting period in Astea history. Our product developers' implementation of NET has delivered a unique framework for Web-based applications that changes how e-Business solutions are developed, implemented and maintained. It is Astea's vision of the future and product road map with NET that are winning the business of marquee companies in increasing numbers. "
Doc428,Astea ,2001," While visibility for 2002 is limited, and the timing and strength of a global economic recovery unclear, Astea continues to move forward with a sound business strategy and unique industry differentiation. Our domain expertise in service management is clearly an advantage when a company's enterprise management solution must include equipment service. "
Doc429,Astea ,2001," Astea in 2001 was not immune to economic conditions that restrained capital spending for new business software, but the Company excelled in areas such as larger system sales, new product development, cost management, new business alliances, and attracting top-caliber executives to its senior management team. We are energized and excited by our prospects for 2002 and beyond, and look forward to rewarding your confidence in the vision we share. "
Doc430,Astea ,2001," On behalf of all directors, management and employees of Astea's global organization, thank you for your continuing support. "
Doc431,Astea ,2002,"It is my pleasure to report our progress for 2002. The year was a very exciting one for Astea, marked by some outstanding achievements . "
Doc432,Astea ,2002," Market acceptance of our new Web-based Astea Alliance Version 6 products, introduced in August, led to a substantial increase in new software license revenues in the second half of the year. Astea Alliance v6 delivers our latest enterprise solutions for field services, contact centers, sales, marketing and professional services on a Microsoft .NET-connected Web services platform with full remote portal and mobile access capabilities connecting field employees with the rest of the enterprise. "
Doc433,Astea ,2002," Among sales in North America, the Company attracted new business from leading companies such as Circuit City, Citibank, ITT Industries, McQuay International, Mettler-Toledo, QualxServ and Enovation Graphic Systems, which was the third Fujifilm company to license our products. We experienced similar success internationally with such companies as Fujitsu Services in Belgium, Netherlands and Japan; Samsung Electronics and Building Maintenance Company in the UK; and Skilled Communications Services in Australia. "
Doc434,Astea ,2002," We expect this trend of increasing numbers of contracts with larger corporations to continue into 2003, as the Company continues to move up-market to large enterprise organizations. "
Doc435,Astea ,2002," In 2002, enterprise software industry analysts began to share our vision of a new service strategy and approach called ??Service Lifecycle Management?? (SLM), which more clearly differentiates Astea??s true product functionality from competitors. SLM emphasizes integrating business processes to preserve customer loyalty, capturing and leveraging actionable customer intelligence to increase revenue generation during product and customer lifecycles and increasing the value of new customer additions. By continuously innovating our products with capabilities such as wireless and mobile devices, intelligent device management and workforce optimization, as well as leveraging world-class technology platforms such as Microsoft .NET, Astea is fulfilling its mission to be the premier provider of SLM solutions. "
Doc436,Astea ,2002," Financially, Astea finished the year strongly, posting profitable third and fourth quarters. License revenues for the second half of 2002 grew by 99% over the first half of the year. The Company reduced total operating expenses for the year by $1.2 million, or 6% from fiscal 2001. Our balance sheet remains strong, with cash and investments on hand totaling $5.3 million, or $.36 per share. "
Doc437,Astea ,2002," Although worldwide market conditions that severely depressed demand for enterprise software during 2001 and the first half of 2002 muted our results for the fiscal year, the Company remains on track for success and expects to increase revenues and maintain control of operating expenses in 2003. Astea continues to invest in development, to ensure that our product continues to offer the best solution in the market. "
Doc438,Astea ,2002," Astea is a much stronger company in its market space heading into 2003 than we were heading into 2002. How far the momentum carries us will, in part, depend on the level of improvement in the business climate during 2003. We are encouraged by our recent performance and excited about our prospects moving forward. "
Doc439,Astea ,2002," On behalf of all directors, management and employees of Astea??s global organization, thank you for your continued support. "
Doc440,Astea ,2003,"This year, Astea International will celebrate its 25th year in the service management sector. As we look back at 2003, we recognize it as one of the most challenging in recent memory. Nevertheless, the economic difficulties suffered not only by Astea but by the entire enterprise software industry have helped us to emerge as a stronger, more tightly focused Company. We are satisfied that in 2003 we continued to invest time and resources in the further development of our core product suite and in our delivery capabilities. "
Doc441,Astea ,2003," Despite our difficulties, 2003 was not without its highlights. Among sales throughout the world, the Company attracted new business from companies such as Gambro and Ascent Media in the US, Axis Computers/Sapura in Asia-Pacific, and MOBA, Thales, and Atlet Limited in Europe. In addition to these, the Astea reseller program in Japan closed some important deals including NSAT, Fuji Photo, Kodak, and Ebarra. "
Doc442,Astea ,2003," In 2003, the Company continued to add the functionality that customers demand by integrating Astea Alliance with key partner technologies. Specifically, we integrated Business Objects for service management reporting; and our mobile solution has been Microsoft Pocket PC certified. We look forward in 2004 to delivering our Microsoft .NET-based product to provide a platform for the flexibility and scalability our global customers require. "
Doc443,Astea ,2003," Astea continues to be acclaimed by its customers as the best in breed provider of service management solutions. In March of 2004, the Company was hailed by customers Enovation Graphic Systems (a FujiFilm Company), TecServ (a Castle Rock Industries Company), Lowry Computers and Data#3 as making a positive impact on their service businesses in respect to increasing service revenues, decreasing operating costs and accelerating business process integration from M&A activities. "
Doc444,Astea ,2003," This is not to downplay the problems we experienced in 2003. The year was a difficult one, but we are encouraged by our early performance in 2004 and excited about our prospects moving forward. We have already seen these efforts bear fruit, and are excited at the increased levels of interest in our solution as the business climate for enterprise software solutions continues to improve. "
Doc445,Astea ,2003," On behalf of all directors, management and employees of Astea??s global organization, thank you for your continued support. "
Doc446,Astea ,2004,"This year has been a year that represents great progress and increasing market traction for our solution. The addition of multiple large enterprise customers in 2004 was a strong indicator of the growing demand for Service Lifecycle Management solutions, as well as proving our ability to successfully compete in this dynamic market. "
Doc447,Astea ,2004," In 2004, the Company had several significant enterprise deals. In the US, these deals included, Mettler Toledo, manufacturer and marketer of weighing instruments; Smith??s Detection, a leader in security and detection devices; IMI Cornelius, the world??s leading supplier of beverage dispensing and cooling equipment; and Carrier Corporation, a premier manufacturer of residential, commercial, and industrial air-conditioning, heating, refrigeration, and ventilation equipment. Additionally, our presence in the Japanese market proved to be significant, with new customers such as, TEC and MT Services East; CTCT; Fuji Photo; Johnson & Johnson; Kodak; NSAT and Shinko Services. Other wins included AllTech Medical Engineering in Asia, Leisure Link in the UK, and EDS GFS in Germany. "
Doc448,Astea ,2004," Astea had a very busy and productive year in regards to implementations. The company rolled out 27 projects worldwide. Among the implementations were JCI in France; Atlet and PM Onboard in the UK; Pomeroy, JCI, and Circuit City in the US; and Xceed Pasifika in Fiji; GDC in New Zealand; and CTC in Japan. "
Doc449,Astea ,2004," During the 2nd quarter of 2004, we rolled out our new Astea Alliance suite built completely on the Microsoft .NET platform. This robust solution integrates and optimizes business processes for Contact Center, Field Service, Deport Repair, Logistics, Professional Services, and Sales & Marketing, by driving operational and financial benefits for our customers. This release was a tremendous accomplishment for Astea. The open, scalable and flexible architecture now saves time and money by being able to deliver products to the market faster, enabling us to connect to our partners easier, as well as integrate with other disparate systems within an enterprise. As a result it has been a great competitive differentiator, which has been well received by both customers and industry analysts. "
Doc450,Astea ,2004," Moving forward, one of our key focuses is to further strengthen Astea??s sound position as a global contender within the international market. Furthermore, we will undertake every effort to improve Astea??s business processes and procedures, cut costs, and enhance efficiency. We will continue to adapt our product portfolio to changing customer requirements, delivering innovative and holistic products and solutions matching their needs for even better service management. "
Doc451,Astea ,2004," We thank our employees for their continuous commitment and enthusiasm in serving the Company with all their capability and competence. Our thanks are likewise extended to our customers and business friends and especially, our shareholders. Our efforts are motivated by your confidence maintaining and strengthening this is our duty. "
Doc452,Autodesk ,1995,"for autodesk, fiscal year 1995 was a year of growth and success - milestones were achieved, goals met and exceeded, and our strategic focus further developed and executed. "
Doc453,Autodesk ,1995," last year we shared some very exciting news with you - we attained the number-one position in the design-automation software industry. dataquest, a leading market-research firm, recently had this to say about autodesk: when autodesk earned the #1 market position in cad this time last year, we described the company's lead as unstoppable. our view has not changed. our view has not changed either: with the achievements of fiscal year 1995, we took another giant step forward and are well on our way to our goal of becoming a one-billion-dollar software company. "
Doc454,Autodesk ,1995," in the past fiscal year, we concentrated on better serving our customers and the core markets- design automation and multimedia - in which they work. we now provide a more robust, cohesive and customer-driven product family. this strategy has meant releasing not only new products, but the right products. "
Doc455,Autodesk ,1995," we also undertook a measured investment in our worldwide infrastructure. we opened new offices, secured exceptional management talent, developed and acquired complementary products and technologies and created market-driven programs. the soundness of these continuing investments was proven in autodesk's fiscal year 1995 results. "
Doc456,Autodesk ,1995," we reported net revenues for the fiscal year ended january 31 1995 of 454.6 million, an increase of 12 percent over new revenues of 405.6 million for the previous fiscal year. these figures reflect a tremendous fourth quarter in which revenues increased by 27 percent, growing from 102.1 million for the same quarter in the prior fiscal year to 129.6 million. our increase in net revenues during fiscal year 1995 was attributable to solid revenue growth in all geographies. for example, in autodesk's fourth quarter, net revenues in the america increased by 13 percent, asia/pacific net revenues increased by 31 percent, and europe posted a record 45 percent gain over the same period in the prior fiscal year. "
Doc457,Autodesk ,1995," excluding the impact of a onetime charge of approximately 26 million, net income for fiscal year 1995 was 73.1 million or 1.47 per share compared to 62.2 million or 1.25 per share in fiscal 1994. the onetime charge, related to a judgment in a trade-secrets lawsuit, reduced fiscal year 1995 net income per share by 0.33. we are appealing the ruling. "
Doc458,Autodesk ,1995," strong demand for autocad software, including autocad release 13, which began shipping at the end of november 1994, also contributed to our success. with its rearchitected core technology, autocad release 13 is the most powerful, customer-driven autocad software ever and serves as the technical cornerstone of our product and market expansion. "
Doc459,Autodesk ,1995," the initial adoption rate of autocad release 13 has been strong, partly because of more rapid product localization. for the first time, we were able to ship autocad in 10 major languages on two platforms during the first quarter of its availability. and, since the installation process for autocad release 13 in the us now requires authorization codes, we can register nearly 100 percent of these autocad customers. this is another important first for us, one which provides a tremendous opportunity to market back to our growing customer base. "
Doc460,Autodesk ,1995," we are reaching these customers with several new software products targeted for specific market applications - in a variety of languages and for numerous hardware and software operating systems. for example, to meet the growing demand for data management software, we introduced autodesk workcenter, which allows our customers to easily streamline the flow of documents and files. we also launched powerful, new releases of 3d studio of autovision, our popular multimedia and visualization products. and, to further expand our mechanical design offerings, we shipped autocad designer for pcs and workstations. these products, along with those of our autodesk registered independent application developer partners, provide customers with a wealth of functionality and play a key role in extending autodesk technology into new and complementary markets. "
Doc461,Autodesk ,1995," the breadth and strength of our product family resulted in the expansion of our customer based around the world. we achieved a significant milestone when consolidated edison, a major new york utility, because our one-millionth autocad customer. avondale industries, one of the us navy's largest shipbuilders, also turned to our cohesive solutions, while in europe, the swiss federal railroad company, sbb, standardized on autodesk products for its design work. and in asia, the japan airline co ltd (jal), and kansai international airport ltd rely on autocad software for ongoing design and maintenance. "
Doc462,Autodesk ,1995," to position autodesk for continued market expansion and growth, we organized the company around key market groups at the beginning of fiscal year 1996. each of these groups is chartered with bringing customer-specific products to market, which we believe will result in broader market coverage and greater selection for our customers. "
Doc463,Autodesk ,1995," today, autodesk leads the design-automation and multimedia markets. with our rearchitected core technology, increased customer focus, strong balance sheet, and the passion and dedication of our nearly 1800 employees, we believe that we are poised to achieve even greater success. we thank our stockholders, customers, partners, and employees for their support as we continue to transform the world's most innovative ideas into tomorrow's realities. "
Doc464,Autodesk ,1996,"last winter when i first began thinking about this letter, i recalled one incident from fiscal year 1996 with particular clarity. i was meeting with the autodesk mechanical desktop team to discuss beta testing for this new mechanical computer-aided design product. the talk was lively and opinionated. it always is at autodesk. as we got into the rhythm of the meeting, many people seemed to realize at about the same moment that what we'd planned just wasn't going to be enough. "
Doc465,Autodesk ,1996, i'm sure some of us were also thinking about the technology transition problems we were then having with autocad release 13 and about the thousands of customers and partners we were meeting with worldwide who were telling us what was needed to make this release the success it has since become. 
Doc466,Autodesk ,1996," from the seeds of this desktop discussion and out of our experience with release 13, a new model for developing quality software has taken root. it's a model in which autodesk programmers will work side-by-side with our customer's and application developer partners and their customers to shape the final product, to make sure that when it's released, it has the features and the performance gains that design professionals need and expect. and what began as some 60 beta sites for the desktop eventually topped out at more than 700. "
Doc467,Autodesk ,1996," the other hallmarks of this experience, a renewal of vision and the role of dedicated, gifted people in autodesk success, also characterize fiscal year 1996, and our future course. vision has led us into new markets and down exciting paths. we're not just that cad software company anymore, we're a design software company.That story is told throughout this document, and l hope you??ll spend some time with It. Vision has led us as well to a renewed commitment to customers.You'll see some of the results of that commitment when you review our strong product lineup and read about our enhanced support resources. But ultimately, people made the difference in fiscal yearl996. Customers, partners, all of us here at Autodesk helped turn a year of difficult but essential change into a success. "
Doc468,Autodesk ,1996," i can tell you that we are working hard to create the best design software in the industry, that we are committed to superior strategic execution in fiscal year1997, and that we enter our new fiscal year with confidence,with a solid and enduring foundation for success. Now let's look at the bottorn-line results. "
Doc469,Autodesk ,1996," Financial Highlights Net revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31 1996, were $534.2 million, an increase of 17.5 percent over the previous year. Net income was $87,8 million or $1.76 per share compared to $73.1 million or $1.47 per share last year. The fiscal year 1995 earnings figure excludes the $16.5 million earnings impact related to theVMI litigation judgment. Setting aside the litigation accrual, earnings grew 20 percent for the year. "
Doc470,Autodesk ,1996," Sales of 233,000 new AutoCAD seats, a record number and an increase of 15 percent over fiscal year 1995, as well as a 32 percent increase in sales of non-AutoCAD products sparked growth. l??m pleased to tell you that the installed AutoCAD base now approaches 1.5 million seats.The 1996 balance sheet also reflects a $17 million increase in cash reserves over the previous fiscal year, even though we spent nearly $108 million to repurchase stock as part of our ongoing commitment to maintaining stockholder value. "
Doc471,Autodesk ,1996," Net revenues by geography were up worldwide. Europe led that annual growth with an increase of 33 percent, its highest in more than 5 years. Asia/Pacific increased by 23 percent; the Americas by only 3 percent, a direct result of the execution problems we had with AutoCAD Release 13 "
Doc472,Autodesk ,1996," A Tough Transition A Positive Outcome The core AutoCAD rearchitecting we undertook for Release13, which incorporated a new object-oriented design paradigm, made for a difficult transition. But the final AutoCAD Release 13 platform, for Windows??95 and Windows NT,?? is an excellent product. lt??s significantly faster than the original product and includes new features, some of which,such as real-time Pan and Zoom, customers had wanted for a long time. AutoCAD release 13 also plays particularly well with new customers who want to pursue a more-collaborative design process using intelligent digital models.That story is also told within this document. "
Doc473,Autodesk ,1996," The final Release 13 platform contains the revolutionary new application programming interface, the AutoCAD Runtime Extension (ARX). Developer partners and customers will leverage ARX to create high-powered applications that are integrated into, not merely compatible with, Release 13. Reaching the ARX milestone is sure to add to AutoCAD success in fiscal year 1997 and beyond. "
Doc474,Autodesk ,1996," The Design Software Company Our reorganization around customer-focused market groups began to reach a critical mass in fiscal year 1996. The products these groups are launching in fiscal year 1997 speak strongly to our traditional, but rapidly evolving markets and effectively position us in new ones, authenticating our view of ourselves as the world's leading design software company. To signal this shift we have even changed our Nasdaq stock symbol from AGAD to ADSK. "
Doc475,Autodesk ,1996," In first quarter 1997 we shipped Autodesk Mechanical Desktop for mechanical design. The Desktop with newly developed assembly-modeling technology integrates AutoCAD Release 13, AutoCAD Designer,and AutoSurf?? modules for a comprehensive art-to-part mechanical-design environment. Later in fiscal year 1997 we will be launching AutoCAD Map, the first in a planned series of AutoCAD flavors in which Release13 technology Wlll be customized and complemented to better suit the needs of our vertical markets "
Doc476,Autodesk ,1996," When you're first in world markets, as we are in CAD software revenues and in seats for animation and visualization, you're expected to lead. So look for our multimedia team to create a stir as the newly formed Kinetix. Autodesk was born out of an entrepreneurial spirit and continues to foster it, which is why we've launched Kinetix as a separate division. And if you haven't already heard about the new Kinetix animation product 3D Studio MAX.?? believe me, you will in fiscal year 1997. "
Doc477,Autodesk ,1996," The work of our Data Management Market Group in fiscal year 1996 moves us strongly into new markets for the electronic publishing of design content through Autodesk Data Publishing (ADP) and for design process management software like Autodesk WorkCenter. Finally, we're licensing Autodesk technology as OEM engines to select developer partners, a move that further strengthens the competitive advantage of our DWG file format, the worldwide standard for computer-aided design. "
Doc478,Autodesk ,1996," Each new business opportunity we're pursuing is volume based, markets to existing customers, wins us new ones, and adds to our competitiveness "
Doc479,Autodesk ,1996," Looking Ahead i believe Autodesk is now better positioned to pursue multiple, global opportunities than at any time in our history. Our business model is more integrated and focused, our products support the needs of a total design environment, our partners are stronger, our customer base larger We're learning, changing, and growing. in fiscal year 1997 we want to delight our customers with quality software. i can't state our future goals any more clearly or powerfully than that. We hope you'll continue to share in our vision. "
Doc480,Autodesk ,1996," And to those people customers, business partners, stockholders, the Autodesk workforce who were so very loyal during a challenging business year i extend my personal thanks. "
Doc481,Autodesk ,1997,"To say FY97 was a difficult period for Autodesk and its partners would be an understatement. Europe, our largest market last year and one that had previously shown steady growth, entered an economic slowdown. The strength of the US dollar hurt us on foreign currency exchange, and we just didn't achieve the sales volumes expected for AutoCAD?? Release 13. For the first time in company history, Autodesk experienced a decline in revenue and loss of some relative market share. "
Doc482,Autodesk ,1997," But FY97 was also a very exciting business year. We shipped more than 20 new products, carried forward our market group diversification strategy, and pioneered Internet-based design technology. We also entered the final testing stages of what promises to be the fastest, most compelling, and highest quality AutoCAD ever developed AutoCAD Release 14. "
Doc483,Autodesk ,1997," In my letter this year, I want to speak frankly with you about both the good and the bad of FY97. I'll start by reviewing our financial performance. "
Doc484,Autodesk ,1997," Net revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 1997, were $497 million, down approximately 7 percent from the previous fiscal year. Net revenues by geography were down 11 percent in Europe, down 10 percent in the Americas, and up approximately 5 percent in Asia/Pacific. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted revenues for the year by more than $17 million. "
Doc485,Autodesk ,1997," While the majority of this slowdown was AutoCAD related, we continued to grow the installed base by 15 percent and maintained AutoCAD upgrade revenue at just over 9 percent of total revenues. We shipped more than 200,000 new copies of AutoCAD for the year, bringing the installed base to more than 1.6 million seats. "
Doc486,Autodesk ,1997," Total non-AutoCAD revenues were up 28 percent over the previous year. We grew the installed base for our second-highest revenue generator, AutoCAD LT??, by 55 percent to 450,000 units. Other year-end installed base numbers include 25,000 units for Mechanical Desktop?? software more than five times its nearest competitor and 26,000 units for 3D Studio MAX??. Total Kinetix?? revenues grew only 11 percent; however, revenues for 3D Studio?? and 3D Studio MAX software posted sequential growth for every quarter and finished the year up 33 percent. "
Doc487,Autodesk ,1997," Net income for FY97 was $42 million, or $0.88 per share, compared to $88 million, or $1.76 per share, in fiscal year 1996. FY97 results include onetime charges of approximately $0.10 per share related to strategic acquisitions made during the year. "
Doc488,Autodesk ,1997," The balance sheet for FY97 year-end remained very strong as reflected by the $14 million increase in cash and marketable securities from a year ago to $286 million, despite spending $67 million repurchasing Autodesk shares and $10 million on acquisitions. Both receivable and inventory levels improved. In addition, the increased linearity of our business coupled with strong cash collections have led to days sales outstanding lower than they have been in more than five years. "
Doc489,Autodesk ,1997," Five years ago, we made a decision to rearchitect AutoCAD software to take advantage of the performance potential of object-oriented technology. We made the right decision. That strategy has moved us years ahead of the competition, but it also presented key challenges and not just from an engineering standpoint. To take advantage of AutoCAD Release 13 and the 32-bit operating system it is designed for, most of our customers had to upgrade their hardware and operating systems. Because object-oriented file formats are structured differently from procedural formats and require different application programming interfaces (APIs), our independent developers also faced some substantial reengineering challenges for their add-on products. "
Doc490,Autodesk ,1997," These key challenges have largely been met during the last year. The power and capacity of Pentium?? systems, and their declining costs, have taken care of the hardware dilemma, and the Windows NT?? and Windows?? 95 platforms are firmly established as the operating systems of choice. With AutoCAD Release 13 c4 we achieved Windows 95 compliance with a high-quality product. And developers began delivering impressive object-oriented add-on applications. "
Doc491,Autodesk ,1997," So we entered FY97 with high hopes for AutoCAD Release 13 in the last year of its product cycle. But our customers still didn't upgrade in the numbers we expected. To learn firsthand from our AutoCAD Release 12 users why so many were choosing not to buy AutoCAD Release 13, every member of the executive staff and a number of employees conducted a phone survey. Our customers told us that the initial negative perception some users had of AutoCAD Release 13 during its first year on the market discouraged others. In fact, due to the early perception problems, almost 30 percent of poll respondents had never even seen a Release 13 demo. Finally, even though AutoCAD Release 13 was the 13th release of AutoCAD software, it was the first release of our new object-oriented architecture, and it behaved like a release-1 product. "
Doc492,Autodesk ,1997," We paid attention to what our survey participants said about their quality expectations. (I'll have more to say about that later when I discuss the prerelease testing we've been conducting with AutoCAD Release 14.) But we also received encouraging news from our users. They told us that they still believe in our products and in our company. They'll upgrade from Release 12, they said, when they have a compelling reason to do so. They'll have that reason with AutoCAD Release 14. "
Doc493,Autodesk ,1997," Even though FY97 was a tough financial year for the company, we took significant steps to support our dealers and developers. Lower product inventories and higher specialization demands are the wave of the future, and we helped our channel partners prepare by stepping up our vertical-market training seminars around the world and by continuing to move closer to a just-in-time approach to product inventories. "
Doc494,Autodesk ,1997," We're focusing on the Internet as the technology of choice for providing more timely interactivity among our channel partners, developers, and customers. We launched the Autodesk?? Developer Network, an online product marketing and technical support extranet that enables our virtual corporation partners to tap into a controlled-access area of our internal communications network. We're taking a similar approach with customer service by developing online product registration and technical support a key charter of our newly formed Customer Satisfaction Center. "
Doc495,Autodesk ,1997," We also sharpened our focus by moving away from non-Windows?? platforms and concentrating our product-engineering effort on Microsoft?? Windows NT- and Windows 95-based products. These are the PC platforms of choice, and we gain product integrity and development momentum by focusing on them. "
Doc496,Autodesk ,1997," We built up our market groups, adding staff in key areas so that we could continue our product diversification strategy. We'll see the results of these efforts throughout FY98 with the release of several new products. "
Doc497,Autodesk ,1997," And we shipped a number of vertical-market products in FY97. The GIS Market Group released AutoCAD Map??, the first vertical-market flavor of AutoCAD software. The GIS team will follow up in the first half of FY98 with a high-level mapping and GIS analysis product Autodesk World??. Both these products, combined with Autodesk MapGuide??, the group's Internet-based server and client software, make this a market group to watch in the coming year. The worldwide mapping/GIS market is growing and the Autodesk GIS Market Group is poised to provide total solutions. "
Doc498,Autodesk ,1997," The Mechanical Market Group showed some real velocity its theme for FY97 by launching Mechanical Desktop software and then delivering two upgrades in its first 10 months. Mechanical Desktop has received strong praise from industry-leading companies for its powerful 3D functionality, best-of-class design-through-manufacturing solutions, and low price point. The MCAD team leveraged its third-party development partnership with 15 key mechanical-design firms the Mechanical Applications Initiative to land volume sales contracts with such internationally known firms as ABB, Hughes Space and Communications Group, Philips, Siemens, and Wisne. The MCAD Market Group will also release a mechanical-flavored AutoCAD during FY98. "
Doc499,Autodesk ,1997," We complemented our Autodesk?? Mechanical Library series with new subscription products from the AEC Market Group PlantSpec?? and DesignBlocks??. These CD-ROM subscriptions contain hundreds of thousands of parts from leading manufacturers in the mechanical, process and power, and building/construction industries. We also offered a Web-based subscription option, PartSpec?? Online, this year. "
Doc500,Autodesk ,1997," Our Data Management Market Group continues to study the opportunities in this market. We delivered a successful WorkCenter?? product two years ago, but our customers' workgroup-size demands have outpaced our original technology. We took important steps to address this customer need in FY97 by entering a joint-development agreement with Documentum, Inc. Utilizing Documentum's Enterprise Document Management System and middleware technology, future releases of WorkCenter will have the flexibility to support larger design workgroups and to provide enhanced workflow capabilities. We also shipped versions of WorkCenter for Windows 95 and Windows NT this year, and we will be releasing WorkCenter?? for the Web in Q2 enabling design teams to use both company intranets and external Internet sites to share controlled-access AutoCAD DWG files. "
Doc501,Autodesk ,1997," FY97 also marked the debut of a low-end product that has already made quite an impression on the retail market. The Advanced Product Group's Picture This Home!?? Kitchen is the first software title to earn the Good Housekeeping Seal. Featuring point-and-click ease-of-use and photo-quality graphics, this consumer-design product targets impulse shoppers at discount retail outlets. We plan more releases in the Picture This Home! series for FY98. "
Doc502,Autodesk ,1997," Kinetix, now in its second year as a separate Autodesk business unit, will build on its early successes with 3D Studio MAX in the multimedia film, video, and special-effects market even as it targets the AEC design visualization space in FY98. And in the first quarter of the new fiscal year, Kinetix will ship Hyperwire?? software, a 3D authoring tool for the Web. "
Doc503,Autodesk ,1997," And, finally, our AEC Market Group is strategically positioned to provide next-generation solutions in the AEC design space as a result of our March 1997 merger with Softdesk. More than any other independent AutoCAD developer, Softdesk has optimized the object-oriented technology introduced with AutoCAD Release 13 by including intelligent objects in its products. Its software enables designers and drafters to design doors and windows, for example, that remember their door and window properties, no matter where they are moved within a drawing, which means higher productivity for our customers. The new AEC Market Group will ship key Softdesk?? products simultaneously with shipment of AutoCAD Release 14 in the second quarter of FY98. "
Doc504,Autodesk ,1997," During difficult financial periods, companies often show their true character. In their rush to protect the bottom line for the short term, some companies lose sight of long-term strategies an unwise move, in my opinion. In our company, we had our share of spirited debates during executive staff meetings about whether to modify our short-term strategies, but I'm proud to say that no one argued against investing in Autodesk's long-term growth. "
Doc505,Autodesk ,1997," We chose not to introduce a hiring freeze, for example, because we needed to invest in our market groups to develop the kind of products that will help us lead the field in FY98 and beyond. However, during this time I did institute a policy that required my personal approval for each new position. Nor did we scale back our acquisition plans. During Q1, we acquired Creative Imaging Technologies. That acquisition led to the release of Picture This Home! Kitchen by our Advanced Products Group and our entry into the consumer home-decorating and home-remodeling markets. The image-analysis technology we acquired along with our purchase of Teleos Research will strengthen future product-development efforts from our Advanced Products Group. Our acquisition of Argus Technologies during the third quarter enabled the GIS Market Group to offer Internet-based solutions with its Autodesk MapGuide products. "
Doc506,Autodesk ,1997," We are making the Internet a large part of our development strategy because we think it's inevitable that design teams will migrate to the Net during the next several years. Design is no longer an isolated act. It's a collaborative process involving not only internal team members but customers and contractors frequently located in other cities, states, or even countries. We see a great future for us in bringing design teams together on the Internet. During FY97 we established a leadership position for Internet-enabled CAD by introducing the AutoCAD?? Release 13 Internet Publishing Kit. Using this technology, AutoCAD users can convert DWG files to our new drawing Web format (DWF) and post them to Web sites. We have built this capability into AutoCAD Release 14. Our Autodesk MapGuide product brings GIS applications to the Web, and we are pioneering the exchange of vector-based digital content on the Web with PartSpec Online. "
Doc507,Autodesk ,1997," In addition to making more of our products Web-capable, we will use the Internet more and more for customer service and technical product support. "
Doc508,Autodesk ,1997," Not only did we invest in acquisitions, we also moved ahead with product development across all markets. In FY98 several of our market group teams will introduce second- and third-generation product releases, but none will be more anticipated than the next release from our AutoCAD Market Group. By the time you read this letter, AutoCAD Release 14 software will be in customers' hands. That is if and only if the AutoCAD Release 14 team achieves its quality and performance objectives. Judging by the reports we've received from alpha and beta testers, those targets will not only be met they'll be exceeded. "
Doc509,Autodesk ,1997, Our users helped us focus on the theme for this release performance. They want software that will allow them to produce a maximum number of drawings in a minimum amount of time. Our alpha and beta testers reported early on that the performance is there faster than even Release 12 for DOS. 
Doc510,Autodesk ,1997," But we had another overriding theme for Release 14, and users helped us maintain our focus on this as well. We took steps to build quality in from the very beginning. We began by specifying our product through market research and by collecting customer feedback. Programmers reviewed this data, designed feature areas in detail, then proposed their work to a review board that included quality assurance (QA) testing and marketing staff. The team made sure coding for the proposed features could be completed in a high-quality fashion and tested offline by QA before a feature got checked in to Release 14. In addition to QA staff testing, we ran thousands of automated tests on every build. "
Doc511,Autodesk ,1997, We also brought in a corps of Autodesk application engineers and customer power users of AutoCAD from all around the world for four separate testing sessions. Their charter was to try to break the program by recreating the thorniest production problems they'd encountered in the field. Programmers and QA team members sat beside them recording their feedback on the highs and lows of prerelease features and performance. 
Doc512,Autodesk ,1997," We launched an alpha testing program that in five months grew from 30 testers to more than 1,000. And then in our final testing stage, we drew upon the design talent of more than 16,000 beta testers to polish our product. We are very pleased with the results. We believe AutoCAD Release 14 will restore the confidence of our user base and win new volume accounts. "
Doc513,Autodesk ,1997, We are using this build-the-quality-in approach in developing all of our products. And our customers will continue to be a vital part of our development teams. 
Doc514,Autodesk ,1997," I want to conclude by talking with you about some intangibles. We made several decisions during this year that can't be easily quantified, but they were decisions that will help return us to a leadership and revenue growth position in FY98. "
Doc515,Autodesk ,1997," At the executive staff level, we appointed Eric Herr president and chief operating officer. The sales geographies, the majority of the market groups, and Operations now report to Eric. That has allowed me to devote more of my time to overseeing product development and quality standards and to carrying out long-term growth strategies. "
Doc516,Autodesk ,1997," Management and employees are sharing the responsibility for this year's disappointing results by forgoing performance bonuses and delaying salary action until mid-FY98. While this decision helps lower costs, another all-hands effort promises to have an even more profound impact on the company's bottom line. Every employee is taking part in a campaign to return Autodesk to revenue growth and market leadership. We're basing this campaign on five carefully developed key initiatives, and we're calling this effort the relaunching of Autodesk. "
Doc517,Autodesk ,1997," We have set the performance bar very high with this all-hands campaign, but as I reflect on the past year in many ways, the most difficult in Autodesk history I feel confident that we will meet and exceed our own expectations. I feel that way because of the spirit and determination I see in every Autodesk employee. We've been battered a bit, but we are by no means down. Our collective resolve will put Autodesk back on track in FY98. "
Doc518,Autodesk ,1997," I also take heart from the loyalty of our stockholders. I want to express my sincere appreciation to those of you who have invested for the long term, who have stood by us during this most trying year, and who have encouraged us to follow our long-term strategies. Indeed we have stayed on course, and we believe you will be rewarded for your faith in Autodesk in FY98 and beyond. "
Doc519,Autodesk ,1997, I'll close by saying that the proof is in the performance. Our focus in the coming year will be on just that. All of the hard work that went into product development and into sales and marketing over the past year will provide a great foundation for our future. I'm excited by the many opportunities ahead. 
Doc520,Autodesk ,1998,"In fiscal year 1998 (FY98) we reestablished our reputation for high-quality design software, we demonstrated our leadership in design technology, and most important of all, we restored customer and partner confidence. "
Doc521,Autodesk ,1998, We grew our vertical-market customer base and won important major accounts in all our design markets in every region. 
Doc522,Autodesk ,1998, And we posted record revenues. 
Doc523,Autodesk ,1998," In last year??s annual report, we spoke to you about our plan to relaunch Autodesk as a company that delights customers, outdistances the competition, and provides long-term stockholder value. This plan was not offered lightly, and our partners joined with every employee to embrace its challenges. "
Doc524,Autodesk ,1998," Today, we??re very proud to report that we have executed on every one of our stated objectives. "
Doc525,Autodesk ,1998," We delivered a compelling, fast, and unquestionably high-quality AutoCAD?? Release 14 product that delights design professionals. We developed and delivered families of software solutions for customers in specific design industries. We built Internet-enabled products with next-generation technologies and introduced the design paradigms of tomorrow. We even moved closer to just-in-time inventory, so we and our resellers could think less about supply and better concentrate on meeting customer demand. "
Doc526,Autodesk ,1998, We promised you that FY98 would be about performance. It was. 
Doc527,Autodesk ,1998," Net revenues grew 24 percent to $617.1 million. Excluding nonrecurring charges, diluted earnings per share rose more than 49 percent to approximately $1.45. "
Doc528,Autodesk ,1998," Geographically, net revenues for the Americas region reached a record $288 million. Despite changes in foreign currency exchange rates that pulled down overseas revenues by nearly $30 million, Europe grew 10 percent. Asia Pacific, handicapped by several troubled economies, maintained flat year-over-year revenues. "
Doc529,Autodesk ,1998," Customers purchased 244,000 new AutoCAD units, bringing the licensed base to nearly 1.9 million seats. Existing AutoCAD customers pushed upgrade revenues to a record $108 million, more than double the upgrade revenues of any previous fiscal year. Non-AutoCAD revenues climbed 24 percent and, against record AutoCAD sales, accounted for 30 percent of total company revenues. "
Doc530,Autodesk ,1998," The balance sheet remained very strong. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities increased $15 million to $301 million, despite our repurchasing 5.3 million Autodesk shares for $175 million and our investing $21 million in strategic technologies and partnerships. The company reached record sales, low channel inventories, all-time high cash collections, and the lowest days sales outstanding in more than a decade. "
Doc531,Autodesk ,1998," If we can impress upon you one message about Autodesk??s future, it is this: We are growing, and will continue to grow, in three important ways. "
Doc532,Autodesk ,1998, We are winning more AutoCAD customers. 
Doc533,Autodesk ,1998, We are providing more vertical-market solutions to an expanding AutoCAD customer base; these complementary products also help drive AutoCAD sales. 
Doc534,Autodesk ,1998," And with our new design technologies, we are reaching deeper into the design world to attract a previously untapped pool of customers. "
Doc535,Autodesk ,1998," There is no question that the May launch of AutoCAD Release 14, our foundation product, propelled the company??s growth in FY98. It??s a great self-contained productivity tool, fast and feature rich. And, with the breakthrough ObjectARX??; object-oriented programming environment, it is proving itself an even greater development platform. AutoCAD software??s new-unit and upgrade sales worldwide remain at higher levels, a year after we first shipped it, than at the same point during any previous release cycle. "
Doc536,Autodesk ,1998," Yet you will see that the deeper story of FY98, and an even more powerful indicator of our financial future than the success of AutoCAD, is the success of our market diversification strategy. "
Doc537,Autodesk ,1998," If you have been with us for a while, you know that three years ago we reorganized the company into Market Groups. These independent internal organizations develop families of products that solve the myriad design challenges of customers in specific industries, or vertical markets. Simply put, design customers work in vertical markets mechanical design, say, or mapping and in FY98 we began to deliver the vertical-market solutions our customers want. "
Doc538,Autodesk ,1998," But we do not try to do it all. Our 2,600-strong developer partner network is taking advantage of our additional offerings, enlarging its range of specialty applications. This solution coverage helps us meet the needs of more customers more completely and further drives sales of Autodesk products. "
Doc539,Autodesk ,1998," You can count on more of the same in fiscal year 1999. We will continue to invest in our Market Groups and vertical-market product families. We will fully support our Market Groups by completing, worldwide, the vertical-market realignment of our sales force and our reseller and distribution channels. And as we extend our vertical-market solutions, our developer partners can increasingly share in, and promote, our success. "
Doc540,Autodesk ,1998," Of course, Autodesk technologies form the heart of our vertical-market solutions and are key to this year??s growth as well as next year??s opportunities. "
Doc541,Autodesk ,1998," Technology leadership gives our customers the best, most cost-effective solutions for the work they do today, and it is why they are partnering with us to meet the design challenges of tomorrow. Bolstered by unprecedented investment in research and development and acquisitions in FY98, our technology leadership is stronger now, we feel, than at any time since the company??s founding. "
Doc542,Autodesk ,1998," We can be even stronger in the years ahead. Our current development efforts center on three burgeoning areas 3D, object-oriented, and Internet technologies because we believe these are the ones that will best serve the design world in the short and long term. "
Doc543,Autodesk ,1998, We will highlight specific product technologies for you when we discuss the Market Groups and the markets they serve later in the letter. 
Doc544,Autodesk ,1998," Our vertical-market strategy clearly sparked regional sales. Consider our Americas region. In FY97, the region completely restructured its sales force and its reseller and distribution channels along vertical-market lines. Able to effectively sell and support our full range of vertical-market solutions, the Americas, after years of modest growth, saw its revenues surge 54 percent to account for 47 percent of our FY98 total. "
Doc545,Autodesk ,1998," We expect to complete the vertical-market restructuring of the Europe and Asia Pacific regions this year. Presently, in Europe, AutoCAD Release 14 is selling extremely well and the vertical markets are healthy and getting stronger. As a result, we believe that the region is well poised to advance our vertical-market agenda in FY99. "
Doc546,Autodesk ,1998," Asia Pacific remains an open question. To limit our exposure, we pulled down channel inventory and reduced revenue goals early in the year. But several key countries, at least, appear sound. And sales of AutoCAD Release 14 in Asia Pacific are starting to take off; vertical-market revenues will not be far behind. "
Doc547,Autodesk ,1998," Market focus, superior technologies, and a worldwide reach are powerful assets, but they do not guarantee success. "
Doc548,Autodesk ,1998," Our Market Groups have to broaden their product lines. We must continue to innovate on the Internet. We have to continually make our software easier to use, especially if we are to stay the volume leader in design software. We can never waver from keeping customer satisfaction at the forefront of all we do. "
Doc549,Autodesk ,1998," We know there are many challenges ahead. So we adhere to a business vision as simple as it is powerful: to deliver software that can help our customers solve every design challenge whether they are creating, managing, or merely using and reusing design information, whether their project is simple or complex. "
Doc550,Autodesk ,1998, We are translating this vision into reality through our Market Groups. 
Doc551,Autodesk ,1998," AEC: BUILDING BEYOND AUTOCAD We have been meeting the needs of professionals in the AEC (architecture, engineering, and construction) industries since 1982 for as long as we have been making AutoCAD software. In fact, as you probably know, we created much of AutoCAD software??s functionality with the AEC community in mind. When members of this group began telling us they needed more specialized, fully integrated design solutions, we knew we had to take AutoCAD to the next level of AEC functionality. "
Doc552,Autodesk ,1998," So in March 1997 we merged with the people and products of Softdesk, a leading Autodesk developer partner since 1987. Finding a better technological fit in AEC would be difficult: most of the acquired product line runs on top of AutoCAD and uses object-based technologies developed with our ObjectARX programming environment. "
Doc553,Autodesk ,1998," The merger reinvigorated and enlarged our AEC Market Group, which has begun delivering architectural design, civil engineering, surveying, imaging, and building services product families. Exactly what our customers need. "
Doc554,Autodesk ,1998," ENHANCING COLLABORATION AEC design professionals are using our object technologies for greater efficiencies and to enhance collaboration. Objects encapsulate design information in modules that can be quickly rearranged and reused. These intelligent objects know what they are and how to behave; they can also contain attribute data, which customers can query. Equally important for the interdisciplinary AEC field, individual objects can be defined and published as information-sharing standards. "
Doc555,Autodesk ,1998," We are also harnessing another transformative technology, the Internet, for its powerful support of collaborative design. "
Doc556,Autodesk ,1998," Ford Motor Company, for example, adopted a solution based on AutoCAD Release 14 for design, layout, and analysis in its 185 plants in 30 countries. Using our software??s built-in Internet publishing tools which convert DWG files to our drawing Web format (DWF) for posting Ford employees, Autodesk, and our worldwide partners are sharing information, ideas, and project drawings via the Ford project Web site. It??s working beautifully. "
Doc557,Autodesk ,1998," There is more ahead. In FY99 we plan to deliver two new object-based products AutoCAD Architectural Desktop?? and AutoCAD Land Development?? that integrate AutoCAD Release 14 software with architectural, and civil engineering and surveying, capabilities. We expect these products to become platforms for a full range of other AEC-specific, vertical-market applications. "
Doc558,Autodesk ,1998," The AEC Market Group continues to share its object technologies with, and make use of component technologies from, other Market Groups. And you will see us aggressively moving our multiplying suite of AEC products into international markets. "
Doc559,Autodesk ,1998, Our traditional strength in AEC is fueling a revolution. 
Doc560,Autodesk ,1998, MCAD: GAINING VELOCITY This past year our efforts in the $3.5 billion MCAD (mechanical computer-aided design) market really began to come together. 
Doc561,Autodesk ,1998," We know mechanical customers want to reduce cycle times. Since forming the MCAD Market Group three years ago, we have kept that goal in mind as we built a world-class development team, acquired other companies and technologies, and established strategic partnerships. The result: we are winning customers today we could not have attracted just two years ago. And we are successfully converting our installed mechanical user base more than 600,000 Autodesk seats to our next-generation products. "
Doc562,Autodesk ,1998," Most mechanical-design customers need robust 3D and 2D tools. Our software provides both. The well-deserved popularity of 3D MCAD technologies does not diminish the role of 2D drafting and 2D legacy drawings; they remain the backbone of mechanical design. That is as true for small subcontractors as it is for giant customers such as the ABB Group, General Electric Company, Parker Hannifin Corporation, and Toshiba, Inc. "
Doc563,Autodesk ,1998, Our software also provides a consistent environment for the entire design-through-manufacturing process. For several years we have recruited Mechanical Applications Initiative (MAI) partners to integrate their best-in-class mechanical programs with our software. This year we carefully expanded the MAI network to 17 industry-leading partners. 
Doc564,Autodesk ,1998," GEARING UP FOR THE FUTURE In FY98 the MCAD Market Group doubled the user base for its premier product, Mechanical Desktop?? solid modeling software running on Windows?? 95 and Windows NT??. Its more than 60,000 seats, gained in just two years, put us in a position to challenge the traditional dominance of Unix-based solid modelers. Even more encouraging, large customers are signing on in greater numbers. We already have multiple 100-seat installations and are looking into opportunities for accounts as large as 1,000 seats. This is only the beginning. "
Doc565,Autodesk ,1998," Because Mechanical Desktop 2.0 routinely wins in competitive benchmark situations thanks in part to its advanced ACIS?? 3.0 modeling engine we believe it will outsell previous releases. The next release, Mechanical Desktop 3.0, could achieve even greater success: it will ship in FY99 with the ACIS 4.0 engine and a host of features optimized for use in the consumer products and mold-and-die industries. "
Doc566,Autodesk ,1998, We are also investing in the future. Our growing staff of 140-plus engineers at seven development sites helped us file 16 patent applications and records of inventions in FY98 alone. You can count on these technologies further reducing cycle times and winning us more customers in the coming years. 
Doc567,Autodesk ,1998," In the MCAD market, hard work pays off. "
Doc568,Autodesk ,1998," GIS: COMING ON STRONG In last year??s report, we urged you to watch our GIS (geographic information systems) Market Group. We hope you took our advice. "
Doc569,Autodesk ,1998," Our product line can now address nearly the full spectrum of GIS and mapping functions. And in the expanding GIS market we are gaining a greater share of the fastest growing segments by far, the Windows and Windows NT platforms. "
Doc570,Autodesk ,1998," We believe we have the technologies and business model to sustain, even accelerate, our GIS growth in the coming years. Here??s why: most enterprises depend on information with a location-based component latitudes and longitudes, street addresses, postal codes, floor and room numbers but this vast store of spatial data remains locked within the proprietary file formats, complex software programs, and expensive hardware of entrenched vendors. Our software unlocks it. "
Doc571,Autodesk ,1998," For example, we eliminated the GIS community??s number one problem systems that do not interoperate, data that cannot travel by founding our product line on data integration. "
Doc572,Autodesk ,1998," Our broader objective, however, extends beyond the specialized concerns of GIS professionals. We plan to deliver spatial data to everyone who wants to access, create, analyze, communicate with, and manage it. We call this notion bringing information down to earth??. You might call it good business. "
Doc573,Autodesk ,1998," PRODUCTS FOR THE ENTIRE WORKFLOW All of our GIS products debuted within the last two years, but they are already transforming this marketplace. "
Doc574,Autodesk ,1998," AutoCAD Map??software, whose customer base grew from 4,000 to more than 30,000 in FY98, is becoming the industry-standard CAD tool for creating and maintaining digital maps. "
Doc575,Autodesk ,1998," To query, integrate, and analyze spatial and related data of all kinds without conversion, we offer Autodesk World?? software, the first in its field to be fully compliant with Microsoft?? Office 97. "
Doc576,Autodesk ,1998," Innovative and affordable Autodesk MapGuide?? software supports live, interactive maps over the Internet, the only currently available GIS product to do so. "
Doc577,Autodesk ,1998," We are winning global accounts with governments and with multinational corporations such as Sprint Communications Company, which uses all three of our GIS products. "
Doc578,Autodesk ,1998," To strengthen our product line, we are integrating it with complementary technologies such as Oracle Corporation??s Spatial Cartridge technology and Allaire Corporation??s Cold Fusion?? development system. "
Doc579,Autodesk ,1998," As the industry grows, so does our GIS Market Group from 7 people to nearly 200 in less than three years. We will continue to aggressively invest in new GIS opportunities to move this industry from high-end, closed products to powerful, PC-based solutions. "
Doc580,Autodesk ,1998, There is no mistaking our GIS commitment now. 
Doc581,Autodesk ,1998," KINETIX: OPENING NEW MARKETS Clearly, the 3D animation and visualization technologies from Kinetix, Autodesk??s multimedia division, are market favorites. Yet, to our frustration, Kinetix has had only limited success penetrating the larger population of CAD professionals. "
Doc582,Autodesk ,1998," In FY98 we took a big step forward with 3D Studio VIZ?? software. It enables architects and engineers to visualize their finished designs and to add realistic 3D fly-bys and walk-throughs to their presentations. We based it on 3D Studio MAX?? animation technologies for power, but also made it simple (some say fun) to use. The software??s critical and commercial success suggests that we got it right. We will ship 3D Studio VIZ Release 2 in FY99. "
Doc583,Autodesk ,1998," We are gratified, too, that 3D Studio MAX remains the leading tool for developing 3D games and interactive content. Also, the timing could not be better for its move into film, video, and broadcast. The entertainment industry is converting to Windows-based animation solutions even as it discovers the benefits including low cost, quick production, and reusability of animations such as Dancing Baby. "
Doc584,Autodesk ,1998," THAT BABY CAN DANCE As literally millions of people now know, the Dancing Baby animation created with 3D Studio MAX and its Character Studio?? plug-in gained fame on the Internet before leaping to prime-time TV. We value the unprecedented publicity it has brought us, yet more important, Dancing Baby demonstrates the Internet??s nascent power to cross-fertilize other media and it proves that special effects can succeed outside big-budget movies and science-fiction shows. "
Doc585,Autodesk ,1998," We shipped 3D Studio MAX Release 2 in October with more than 1,000 new features. It has won numerous awards, and you can see its dazzling effects in big-screen movies (Lost in Space), cartoons (Van-Pires), commercials (Cap??n Crunch), video games (Quake), and TV coverage of the 1998 Winter Olympic Games (Ergoman). We will ship 3D Studio MAX Release 2.5, with crucial film and video features, and Character Studio Release 2, with true motion-capture capabilities, later this year. "
Doc586,Autodesk ,1998," We have owned the marketing rights to 3D Studio MAX for many years. This past year we also acquired the technology rights and, significantly, renewed our great joint-development relationship with developer partner The Yost Group. This technology acquisition helps ensure that Kinetix maintains its technology leadership, allows us to incorporate 3D Studio MAX technologies into other Autodesk products, and positions us to create easier-to-use tools that fit even better within our customers?? workflow. "
Doc587,Autodesk ,1998," The audience for Kinetix software, which helps people create content for all media and brings visualization tools to all designers, continues to expand. "
Doc588,Autodesk ,1998, PSG: EXTENDING SOLUTIONS We??ve saved the newest for last. 
Doc589,Autodesk ,1998," We formed the Personal Solutions Group (PSG) because our most important business goal, after delighting customers with high-quality software, is to increase revenues by increasing volume sales. In the hotly contested broad-based CAD and consumer software arena, PSG accounted for revenues of more than $90 million in FY98 and enlarged its customer base to 1.3 million. "
Doc590,Autodesk ,1998," You see, with PSG??s well-priced and easy-to-use design, drafting, drawing, and diagramming products, Autodesk can reach everyone from the professional designer to the home hobbyist. "
Doc591,Autodesk ,1998," This audience includes consumers who need a stand-alone product to fulfill an occasional design need. And it includes the many Autodesk customers who wish to add enterprisewide depth and breadth from conceptualization through management to their current design solutions. We will ship one such tool, a diagramming package code-named Homer, in FY99. "
Doc592,Autodesk ,1998," PSG products extend the coverage of our design solutions matrix. Our goal is to grow the Autodesk product family into a complete array of total design solutions, at numerous price points, across all vertical design markets and the horizontal consumer market as well. "
Doc593,Autodesk ,1998, FAMILIAR TERRITORY It??s a new Market Group but a well-established market for Autodesk. 
Doc594,Autodesk ,1998," You can trace our track record in broad-based CAD back to 1986, when we began shipping AutoSketch?? software; we shipped Release 5.0 in November. And we introduced sub-$500 AutoCAD LT?? software in 1993. Partly on the strength of AutoCAD LT 97, which stands out as the only CAD product fully compatible with AutoCAD Release 14, the installed base for our second-highest revenue generator grew 40 percent to 630,000 customers this past year. "
Doc595,Autodesk ,1998," We make sure all PSG products benefit from the high-end Autodesk technologies they draw upon and our 15 years of CAD expertise. So besides simplicity, a consistent Windows look and feel, standard file formats, modern Internet accessibility, and competitive pricing, every PSG product offers the tools required for completing a job. "
Doc596,Autodesk ,1998," Fundamentally, even our consumer applications such as Planix?? Home Designer 3D Deluxe, which includes 3D walk-through capabilities, and the highly graphical Picture This Home!?? series succeed because of their technological, problem-solving superiority. "
Doc597,Autodesk ,1998," Perhaps more than our other Market Groups, PSG functions as an independent, customer-centric, fast-moving entrepreneurial enterprise. We will continue to explore, create, and capitalize on opportunities in new and established markets, diversifying PSG??s offerings as we go. "
Doc598,Autodesk ,1998, At Autodesk the startup spirit remains alive and well. 
Doc599,Autodesk ,1998," market group growth stands as autodesk's number one fy99 priority and best long-term opportunity. That is how we will win more autocad customers, sell more vertical-market products, and attract more first-time customers. it is how we can achieve solid revenue growth and surpass the 600,000 new software seats we sold last year. and it is why we are calling fy99 the year of the "
Doc600,Autodesk ,1998, market group. 
Doc601,Autodesk ,1999,"in last year's annual report, we promised you that fiscal year 1999 (fy99) would be the year of the market group, that market group growth would stand as autodesk's number one fy99 priority and best long-term opportunity. this was the strategic landmark we'd been working toward for almost four years. In fy98, we'd completed the milestone transition from providing one great design product to whole families of design solutions. and we were confident that we'd laid the groundwork needed to support our company as it took this next significant step. "
Doc602,Autodesk ,1999," today we're proud to report that in fy99 we executed successfully on this strategy by maintaining an unwavering focus. as a result, we grew our business 20 percent last year. and every one of our market groups posted record results with a combined growth rate in excess of 65 percent. all of this proves that - after only four years - the market group strategy has grown from an important idea into a substantial contributor to our business today. "
Doc603,Autodesk ,1999," When we first made the decision to reorganize into market groups, we knew we were taking a risk. After all, there are countless companies that fail to evolve beyond their first success or initial market. But we were willing to take the chance because it was clearly time to move Autodesk beyond AutoCAD?? software into new, faster-growing segments of the design industry. We weren??t looking for a short-term solution, so we made investments in our business that would pay off in the long run. We focused our research and development efforts on 3D, object-oriented, and Internet technologies because we believe these areas will best serve the design world in the future. We studied emerging technologies. We acquired crucial technology and talent to supplement and grow our core competencies. Using our new, customer-oriented development process, we built families of products that customers really want and need. And we executed successfully on our strategy, becoming a serious player in each design market we chose to enter, consciously building both mind share and market share in the process. "
Doc604,Autodesk ,1999," As Autodesk enters a new millennium and a new era as the premier design solutions company, we can say that our decision to implement a market group strategy has paid off handsomely. Led by a strategic-minded management team, staffed by the most innovative, hardworking employees to be found, Autodesk has evolved into a broad-based, diverse company with staying power and even more important, with growing power. "
Doc605,Autodesk ,1999," The design market: exponential growth prospects Not so long ago, our computer-aided design products were developed primarily for the architectural, engineering, and construction (AEC) market, as production tools that helped drafters complete 2D drawings more efficiently. As the CAD market broadened to include a wider range of digital design applications, Autodesk broadened its range of markets and applications as well. "
Doc606,Autodesk ,1999," Today manufacturers depend on our mechanical solutions?? 3D modeling capabilities to reduce cycle times and design, test, and build every type of mechanical product from semiconductor and electronic equipment to custom laser systems and satellites. "
Doc607,Autodesk ,1999," Architects, engineers, and construction companies employ our architectural solutions to design the world??s tallest buildings, largest hotels, and most ambitious, cutting-edge sports facilities. And they use our products?? visualization capabilities to present their concepts in stunning 3D virtual reality. "
Doc608,Autodesk ,1999," Industrial designers rely on our products to blend aesthetics and ergonomics with durable functionality in the form of computers, chairs, watches, water bottles, running shoes, toasters, telephones, toothbrushes . . . all of the designed objects that surround us every day. "
Doc609,Autodesk ,1999," Local governments use our geographic information systems (GIS) software to update parcel information, communicate zoning laws, attract developers, and design more effective disaster-preparedness plans. "
Doc610,Autodesk ,1999," Leading game developers choose our multimedia products for character creation and animation of 3D adventure, action, and strategy games, and major motion picture studios use the same products to create breathtaking special effects. "
Doc611,Autodesk ,1999," And businesses call on our easy-to-learn-and-use personal solutions to design organization charts, office layouts, floor plans, and flowcharts. "
Doc612,Autodesk ,1999," Clearly, our business remains anchored in the time-honored lines, arcs, and circles of the drafter??s two-dimensional drawings. But from that foundation, we??re providing solutions that bridge the worlds of 2D and 3D making the most valuable design tools of the past, present, and future available to our customers. Today our company and its families of design solutions are part of a multidimensional infrastructure upon which the entire commercial world is built the design, construction, maintenance, manufacture, and management of things. "
Doc613,Autodesk ,1999," This is the design market of the future. This is a market that feeds on itself to grow bigger and stronger, more important and more exciting every year. Because we??ve successfully diversified into key market groups, reshaped Autodesk into the premier design solutions company, and established ourselves as technology leaders in multiple, fast-growing areas of the design industry, we??re uniquely positioned to become an integral part of businesses?? design processes around the world. "
Doc614,Autodesk ,1999, But this story is not only about future growth opportunities for Autodesk. It??s about record growth in FY99. 
Doc615,Autodesk ,1999," Financial milestones Net revenues for FY99 were $740 million, an increase of 20 percent over FY98 and a new record even with a 12 percent decrease in our Asian business. On a geographic basis, revenues in the Americas were $347 million, an increase of 20 percent. Revenues for Europe increased 38 percent to $287 million. But the most compelling evidence of Autodesk??s on-target strategies and executions is the near 28 percent growth outside of Asia Pacific, in a year when we did not ship a new release of our flagship product, AutoCAD?? software. "
Doc616,Autodesk ,1999," Even though we did not release a new version of AutoCAD in FY99, we shipped a record 263,000 new seats of it bringing the licensed base to more than 2.1 million seats and posted record upgrade revenue of nearly $112 million. Even with these new highs, our revenue share from stand-alone AutoCAD sales and upgrades decreased from 65 percent to 51 percent, proving that we have diversified into a multiproduct company with leading products in each of our target markets. "
Doc617,Autodesk ,1999," At Autodesk, we report our business in three market segments: Design Solutions (which includes the AECAD, MCAD, and GIS market groups), the Personal Solutions Group, and Kinetix. In FY99, each market segment posted record sales. Revenue for the Design Solutions segment grew from $494 million in FY98 to $575 million in FY99. Our Personal Solutions Group segment??s revenue grew 37 percent to a record $123 million. And our Kinetix?? segment finished the year at $42 million, an increase of 27 percent. "
Doc618,Autodesk ,1999," Net income for fiscal year 1999 was $91 million or $1.85 per share on a diluted basis, including nonrecurring charges as well as amortization of goodwill and intangible assets from prior acquisitions. Excluding these costs, net income was $103 million, or $2.10 per share on a diluted basis. "
Doc619,Autodesk ,1999," The balance sheet remained very strong. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities increased $77 million to $378 million despite our investing more than $76 million in strategic technologies and partnerships. "
Doc620,Autodesk ,1999," Now let??s step back from the big picture, and consider our company??s growth group by group. "
Doc621,Autodesk ,1999," Engineering a mechanical force to be reckoned with When we chose to enter the mechanical market, the industry as a whole didn??t take us very seriously. After all, we were entering at the midrange, where the competition didn??t see much opportunity. Fortunately, we did. Our customers told us they needed this type of solution. And we were determined to meet their needs. So we assembled a world-class team of engineers and managers who worked closely with our customers every day. And we began to deliver high-performance products at midrange prices on a consistent six- to nine-month release cycle. Today our Mechanical Desktop?? and AutoCAD?? Mechanical software serve as two shining examples of great technology developed to help our customers drive down engineering cycle times and solve mechanical design challenges. During FY99 we added to this technology with the acquisition of Genius CAD Software GmbH. And in less than a year, the popularity of this software has spread around the world. "
Doc622,Autodesk ,1999," In FY99, mechanical revenues increased 185 percent year over year, surpassing the $100 million mark. And the installed base for Mechanical Desktop software more than doubled to 123,000 seats. We reached this milestone in just under three years. It took our closest competitor nearly a decade to do the same. They??re definitely taking us seriously now. "
Doc623,Autodesk ,1999," Turning acquired technologies into breakthrough products The AEC market group also reported another record year. In fact, revenue for this group increased more than 50 percent in a market that??s growing in the low double digits. Like MCAD, the AEC group is focused on building great technology. For example, at the time we started the group with the Softdesk?? acquisition in FY98, only 35 percent of the employees were in research and development (R&D). By strategically shifting funds out of the infrastructure, we??ve raised the proportion of employees in R&D to 74 percent. And we produced two new, breakthrough products as a result. AutoCAD Architectural Desktop?? software, launched last fall, enables designers to produce conventional drawings and create intelligent objects. This means they can now create collaborative, intelligent building models that foster the communication of design intent as well as the efficient reuse and sharing of design content. This was never before possible. In December, we launched the civil engineering equivalent of AutoCAD Architectural Desktop, called AutoCAD?? Land Development Desktop. It uses intelligent objects to increase customer productivity and significantly improves data integration throughout the project. And it, too, is off to a spectacular start. "
Doc624,Autodesk ,1999," Building GIS into a volume business Having just completed its third consecutive year of 100 percent-plus growth, GIS at Autodesk is firmly established as a major player in a billion-dollar market that??s packed with potential. That market is as big as the AEC market and growing much faster. In fact, Dataquest estimates that the market for PC-based GIS software will become a $2 billion industry in just five years. And we??re actively preparing to grow with it. More than 250,000 people use AutoCAD?? software for GIS applications. And in the past two years, we??ve developed a modular family of easy-to-use, cost-effective solutions that allow businesses to leverage their huge investments in legacy data and enable end users to access and use GIS data without being GIS experts. That??s why telecommunications and utility companies like Sprint, Time Warner Cable, Scottish Telecom, California??s Pacific Gas & Electric, and Italy??s ENEL chose AutoCAD Map?? software over the competition. That??s why the U.S. Postal Service chose AutoCAD Map to design and maintain its mail handling systems. And that??s why Telia, Scandinavia??s largest telecommunications company, will install Autodesk MapGuide?? software on 30,000 employees?? desktops to expedite the distribution of infrastructure information via the Internet to its field-based personnel. "
Doc625,Autodesk ,1999," Developing the lower end of the design software market We formed our Personal Solutions Group (PSG) in FY98 to expand our traditional customer base of architects and engineers by developing diagramming, drawing, and design tools that sell for less than $1,000. PSG??s customers range from professionals and occasional users to sole proprietors of small businesses. The group??s flagship product, AutoCAD LT?? 98 software, spans our vertical markets as a natural extension to our installed base of design customers. It??s 100 percent compatible with AutoCAD software, so the two applications work side by side in many architecture and engineering offices. In FY99, category-leading AutoCAD LT software exceeded an installed base of 900,000 customers worldwide. "
Doc626,Autodesk ,1999," Just as exciting, we entered a new category and brought another product to market that will continue the PSG trend of multiple market group appeal. Following years of requests from our customers for this type of solution, we developed and introduced Actrix?? Technical software a simple drawing and diagramming tool that virtually anyone can use. But underneath the simple interface lies powerful, sophisticated technology that brings intelligent object-based capabilities to its users. During FY2000, we will extend Actrix into a family of easy-to-use products in specialized diagramming and drawing niches, expanding our reach in the $200 million diagramming market as well. "
Doc627,Autodesk ,1999," Advancing award-winning technology Kinetix, our entertainment and visualization group, had a very successful year as revenues increased 27 percent to a record $42 million. 3D Studio MAX?? software continued to evolve, and it??s now a powerhouse product in three key markets. In game development, 3D Studio MAX was used to design virtually all of the top sellers including Tomb Raider III, Star Craft, and Sim City 3000. In film production, 3D Studio MAX was used to construct most of the buildings in last summer??s hit movie The Truman Show. And in video and broadcast, it was used to create Lisa Loeb??s ??All Day?? music video from the soundtrack of The Rugrats Movie as well as the opening segments and bumper logos for the NFL Super Bowl. "
Doc628,Autodesk ,1999," The other half of the Kinetix?? business is design visualization, and everyone who uses the AutoCAD?? family of products is a potential customer. Designed with architects in mind, 3D Studio VIZ?? software is a design visualization product that simplifies the process of converting 2D drawings into vividly realistic 3D renderings. It??s giving architects a distinct competitive advantage as they use it to sell high-profile projects such as Cincinnati??s new Contemporary Arts Center, Australia??s 2000 Summer Olympics multiuse arena, and the new football stadium for the Seattle Seahawks. "
Doc629,Autodesk ,1999," Of course the big news for the Kinetix market group this year was the acquisition of Discreet Logic, which was completed in early FY2000. Now, all the building blocks are in place the range of products and price points, the sales force, the experience, the customers, the commitment to advance the award-winning technology for which both Discreet and Kinetix have historically been known. Discreet is the leading provider of advanced effects and editing software for the film and broadcast industries. At the high end, Discreet?? software is used for feature film production on award-winning films such as Titanic, Independence Day, Contact, and Apollo 13. In the midrange, television broadcasters use Discreet software to composite real-time digital content and special effects for a customer base that includes MSNBC, the NFL Super Bowl, and the Home Shopping Network. And at the low end, Discreet and Kinetix offer Windows NT based software that game developers, corporate communicators, and e-commerce sites use to design special effects, animations, and web content. Now named the Discreet division of Autodesk, these combined organizations present exciting long-term opportunities in entertainment and design visualization. "
Doc630,Autodesk ,1999," Looking ahead As you can see, FY99 was a great year for Autodesk. We were selected by Fortune magazine as one of the 100 best companies to work for (entering the list for the first time at number 35). We achieved our goal of 20 percent revenue growth. We shipped more than 20 new releases of our design solutions products. We sold a total of 1,000,000 new seats across all market groups. We grew the non-AutoCAD?? portion of the business by 65 percent. And we continued to build mind share and gain market share in every market we serve. But while we enjoy our successes, now is not the time to rest. Instead we must continue to innovate in this rapidly moving, fast-growing industry. "
Doc631,Autodesk ,1999," That??s why we??re pleased to introduce Design 2000 a new era of more powerful, more customer-oriented design software that??s built upon the rock-solid core of AutoCAD 2000 software. This new generation of design productivity tools cuts across design industries and disciplines. From AEC to GIS, from land development to mechanical engineering, our goal for these Design 2000 products is to provide greater productivity to our customers, help them work more intuitively, connect them to their teams, and provide custom tools for their industry??s specialized requirements. "
Doc632,Autodesk ,1999," The foundation technology upon which these solutions are constructed (as well as thousands of third-party applications), AutoCAD 2000 software, is designed to simplify the way our customers work. It connects them to their designs, their extended teams, and their clients with tools that are seamless and easy to use. With this release, AutoCAD software is now fully object-oriented, Windows-centric, powered for 3D, and ready for the Internet. "
Doc633,Autodesk ,1999," Because the Internet continues to grow as a major force in our customers?? businesses, we will continue to innovate in this area. We will continue to add Internet functionality to our products, so our customers can work more efficiently by communicating, sharing, and reusing design data over the Internet. We will continue to build and expand our customer support and training on the autodesk.com website. And we will employ the incredible reach and efficacy of the Internet to streamline and improve all of our internal and business processes including administrative tasks, partner communications, and investor relations. "
Doc634,Autodesk ,1999," In conclusion, our opportunities for growth have never been better. Our management team is experienced and strong. Our sales channels are reshaped and strengthened. And we??re the only single software company in the world today that??s able to provide robust, leading-edge solutions to so many thriving areas of the design industry. As more and more businesses recognize design as a critical component in the overall success of the enterprise, Autodesk will stand ready to help them compete and grow with sophisticated solutions from the premier design solutions company. "
Doc635,Autodesk ,2000,"Let me begin by thanking you, as well as our employees, partners, and customers, for your continued support through an unexpectedly difficult year. "
Doc636,Autodesk ,2000, I believe your confidence in Autodesk is justified. 
Doc637,Autodesk ,2000," The year??s mixed financial results were disappointing. But we know what caused the problems, and we??ve worked through them and moved our business beyond them. "
Doc638,Autodesk ,2000," Most important, we worked hard and smart all year to firmly position the company for a robust future. Not only did we deliver the richest product suite in the design and entertainment industries, but we also hammered out, and began executing, strategic initiatives that leverage our unique and formidable assets as we lead design to the Internet. "
Doc639,Autodesk ,2000," Before I discuss our strategic achievements and what they mean for our future, let??s take a detailed look at the financial challenges we faced beginning with the overall revenue picture. "
Doc640,Autodesk ,2000," The Overall Revenue Picture Overall fiscal year 2000 (FY00) revenues were $820 million, down 6 percent from the previous year. Here??s how the year??s revenues looked by business segment and by region. "
Doc641,Autodesk ,2000, Business Segment Design Solutions revenues fell by 7 percent to $648 million. Discreet revenues equaled the previous year??s $172 million. 
Doc642,Autodesk ,2000," Regions Americas revenues fell 15 percent to $353 million. Europe,Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) revenues fell 10 percent to $296 million. Asia Pacific revenues grew 32 percent to $171 million. "
Doc643,Autodesk ,2000, Now let??s review the challenges that contributed to this revenue picture. 
Doc644,Autodesk ,2000," Challenges We Faced Frankly, the light revenues generated by AutoCAD?? 2000 software surprised us.We knew, based on the terrific reception by thousands of test sites and the industry press, that we??d delivered a great product, a great design platform. And customers told us they planned to buy. "
Doc645,Autodesk ,2000, Yet sales of AutoCAD 2000 were soft.We soon identified the reasons why. 
Doc646,Autodesk ,2000," Many companies were delaying their planned software purchases for the year, diverting budgets into solving the Y2K problem.This, of course, affected many companies including Autodesk. "
Doc647,Autodesk ,2000," And an unexpectedly high number of customers, current and potential,were waiting for AutoCAD LT?? 2000 and the AutoCAD 2000 based market-specific applications: AutoCAD Architectural Desktop??, AutoCAD?? Land Development Desktop, AutoCAD Map??, AutoCAD?? Mechanical, and Mechanical Desktop?? software. "
Doc648,Autodesk ,2000, Market-Specific Applications: A Matter of Timing We??re pleased that customers were so interested in our market-specific products.We??ve been working for years to move them from stand-alone AutoCAD because market-specific products bring in a higher average sales price and can satisfy a larger customer base. 
Doc649,Autodesk ,2000, But we weren??t ready to ship most of these products until the third and fourth quarters.And we didn??t anticipate just how many customers would wait for them. 
Doc650,Autodesk ,2000," Once we did ship the market-specific applications, I have to say,they were very well received. In fact, sales of these products helped our vertical markets, within our Design Solutions segment, increase revenues by 20 percent over the previous year: Geographic Information Systems (GIS) revenues were up 47 percent. Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) revenues were up 21 percent. Manufacturing Design and Information revenues were up 10 percent. "
Doc651,Autodesk ,2000," Cost Cutting Promotes Strong Financial Finish To decrease costs and increase profitability, we reduced our worldwide workforce by 10 percent in the third quarter well before sales of the market-specific applications started enhancing revenues. It was the first such cutback in our history and a difficult time for us all. But I believed then, as I do now, that it was a required step back to financial health. "
Doc652,Autodesk ,2000," Together, the workforce reduction and increased market-specific sales helped boost pro forma operating margins in the last two quarters. (Pro forma excludes amortization of goodwill and nonrecurring charges, primarily related to acquisitions and restructuring charges.) Second-half margins climbed to 13 percent, up from 3 percent in the first half; overall, margins finished the year at 8 percent. "
Doc653,Autodesk ,2000," We also closed the year with a strong balance sheet: cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled $541 million. In addition, we adopted a stock repurchase program for up to 8 million shares and repurchased approximately 2.9 million shares during the year. "
Doc654,Autodesk ,2000," All in all, it was a solid financial finish just one of many reasons why I??m confident that our position in the marketplace is healthy and getting healthier. "
Doc655,Autodesk ,2000, It??s time to look at our strategic achievements and the great opportunities ahead. 
Doc656,Autodesk ,2000, Strategic Accomplishment: Design 2000 Product Suite We developed and delivered a family of AutoCAD 2000 based products that extend our reach into new markets. 
Doc657,Autodesk ,2000," With AutoCAD 2000 as the intelligent and web-ready foundation, our Design 2000 product family provides customers with integrated,scalable solutions for any industry-specific design project from AEC to GIS, from land development to mechanical engineering to low-cost 2D drafting. In addition to this potent platform,we created compatible, innovative technologies for 3D visualization, image conversion, viewing, and redlining and our partners added thousands more. "
Doc658,Autodesk ,2000," Strategic Accomplishment: Autodesk Inventor We developed and delivered Autodesk Inventor?? software, a new-technology 3D modeling solution that is transforming the way mechanical designers work. "
Doc659,Autodesk ,2000," Developed so collaborative project teams could take advantage of crucial,emerging trends in manufacturing and so easy to learn and use that most customers are productive in a single day Autodesk Inventor leapfrogs the limitations of traditional parametric-based modeling systems. Its all-new adaptive technology lets our customers design the way they think. For example, they can design a part??s function before designing its form; this natural, intuitive process gets subverted in most pure parametric systems.With its collaborative capabilities, Autodesk Inventor is the first midprice mechanical solution that can leverage design data across the entire enterprise. And with an exceptional record of industry awards and new releases available every few months, it??s definitely a product to watch. "
Doc660,Autodesk ,2000, Strategic Accomplishment: Key Acquisitions We broadened and strengthened our core competencies in digital content creation and spatial data management with two key first-quarter acquisitions. 
Doc661,Autodesk ,2000," The visual effects,editing,production,and broadcast solutions of Discreet Logic, our largest acquisition ever,gave us a preeminent position in digital content creation far beyond our already strong standing, secured by 3D Studio MAX?? software, in 3D animation and interactive games development. Discreet?? systems and software are widely used to create digital moving pictures for video, HDTV, the Web, broadcast graphics, on-air event coverage, and interactive games. For example, the company??s inferno* system, the industry??s leader in online noncompressed visual effects and compositing,was used in every 1999 film nominated for a Best Visual Effects Academy Award. "
Doc662,Autodesk ,2000," With the world??s most creative on-air, on-screen, and online content-creation solutions, our new Discreet entertainment division proved itself a consistent revenue generator even as we rebuilt its direct-sales force and management team. It made further inroads into TV and film, shipping major new releases of fire* and smoke*, its industry-leading online noncompressed editing solutions; edit*, the award-winning nonlinear Windows NT editing system; and frost*, for on-air, resolution-independent graphics production. "
Doc663,Autodesk ,2000," We also acquired VISION Solutions, whose server technology gives us an end-to-end enterprise solution for spatial data management for the communications and utility markets and government customers. Our VISION*?? backbone server technology links two of our GIS products, AutoCAD Map and Autodesk MapGuide?? software, with Oracle databases. Significantly, our VISION* solution includes consulting services a new growth opportunity for us. "
Doc664,Autodesk ,2000, Strategic Accomplishment: Leveraging the Internet We produced exciting initial results from our three-pronged Internet strategy.The following are just a few samples of what we??ve introduced so far. 
Doc665,Autodesk ,2000," Web-enabled desktop products:We??re integrating our core desktop applications with the Web, enhancing the way customers use them. "
Doc666,Autodesk ,2000," Autodesk?? Product Extensions are web-deliverable feature sets,available in tight release cycles,that ??extend??our products?? capabilities in targeted ways.The first such extension,AutoCAD?? 2000 iX, has been available since the first quarter of FY01. It adds wizard-based publishing tools and enhanced capabilities for collaboration and design sharing to AutoCAD 2000 and products based on AutoCAD 2000; it??s a great example of how we??re leveraging our desktop strength for the Internet. What??s more, this Internet extension provides a live connection to Autodesk?? Point A, our new design portal.Other extensions will follow. "
Doc667,Autodesk ,2000," The Point A portal provides rich online resources to the world??s largest community of designers, engineers, partners, and suppliers. Point A is ??always on?? inside our web-ready software, so customers can extend their knowledge and grab content without leaving their design environment. The portal automatically customizes itself for a customer??s particular discipline, or customers can select a gateway to access the market-specific content of their choice. Point A is also open to the millions of other designers and engineers using Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. I invite you to take a look, at pointA.autodesk.com. "
Doc668,Autodesk ,2000," Browser-based products:We??re creating browser-based products that use the Web to interactively access, update, and disseminate design or spatial information, in real time, to and from any point in the extended enterprise. "
Doc669,Autodesk ,2000," The best example here is the wireless technology platform that we??ve developed with cooperation from Oracle Corporation and several telecommunications firms. The first implementation, Autodesk?? OnSite software, became available in the first quarter of FY01. It lets offsite customers tap into a central database,download fresh data, modify it, and update the database on the fly. Such point-of-work solutions are essential for utility field crews, construction or shop-floor workers, and others who increasingly rely on handheld digital assistants, laptops, tablets, and cell phones. "
Doc670,Autodesk ,2000," Portals and marketplaces: We??re building design portals, such as Autodesk Point A, and business-to-business marketplaces that complement and extend our core desktop business. "
Doc671,Autodesk ,2000," Buzzsaw.com is the first Internet business incubated internally and then spun off, in the fourth quarter, by the Autodesk Ventures group. It attracted $75 million in its first two rounds of venture funding, and Autodesk currently retains 40 percent ownership. Buzzsaw.com targets the huge but fragmented construction industry a $700 billion market in the United States alone. Today it??s the industry??s largest and fastest growing collaboration workspace and online resource, having already hosted more than 6,500 projects with tens of thousands of customers.The marketplace can also be directly accessed, through the Autodesk Point A portal,by the industry??s largest customer base: ours. Please visit buzzsaw.com. "
Doc672,Autodesk ,2000," Autodesk Ventures is incubating a second business-to-business marketplace that will, like Buzzsaw.com, include outside venture funding.The goal of RedSpark, Inc. is to provide the most accessible and complete supply chain sourcing solutions to a targeted sector of the manufacturing industry a $1.8 trillion market in the United States alone. RedSpark will link manufacturers of custom engineered goods and catalog component vendors with buyers and engineers in a collaborative, online environment. Its services, like Buzzsaw.com??s, can also be directly accessed by our mechanical customers through the Autodesk Point A portal.Please take a look at redspark.com. "
Doc673,Autodesk ,2000, Transforming Business by Design This is an auspicious time for Autodesk.Here??s why. 
Doc674,Autodesk ,2000," The design world is vast and enduring. Look around. If what you see wasn??t forged by nature, chances are excellent Autodesk software played a part. (The same goes for much of what you don??t see.) Will Autodesk customers be the ones who continue to modify, add to, and improve our physical and digital environments  Absolutely. "
Doc675,Autodesk ,2000," We??re entering our greatest era of innovation. The Internet is radically changing how people create, maintain, and enhance the real and virtual worlds and we??re adapting to provide our customers with powerful new opportunities in communication, collaboration, content, and commerce. Keep in mind that moving to the Internet is a natural extension of our design and entertainment businesses. "
Doc676,Autodesk ,2000," Autodesk and our customers hold a powerful and unique position. Our 4 million-plus customers, the largest installed base in the design and entertainment worlds, make choices worth trillions of dollars each year. Only Autodesk customers have a strong presence in all the major design and entertainment markets. And they use our software to create the information that is poised to become the universal language for much of e-commerce and other web-based collaboration. "
Doc677,Autodesk ,2000," We can tie together the value chain. We??re doing it with a new business model that has as its center Autodesk and our assets our global customers, our world-class technologies, our industry-leading partners, our sales and service channels, and our brand.We??re adding spin-offs and strategic investments and alliances.Digital information can now be leveraged throughout a corporation??s entire value chain to bring new competitive advantages.As our network of businesses grows and evolves,we??ll reach far more customers than we do today. "
Doc678,Autodesk ,2000, The design world is becoming increasingly connected. And so are we. 
Doc679,Autodesk ,2001,"What a year! Several years ago, Autodesk pioneered the creation of design data and digital content.Today,we??re moving beyond automating the creation of this information to targeting how our customers manage, use, and share it, keeping design data and content digital throughout the process. Our success is undisputed and our drive remains undiluted.We??re simplifying the ways our customers can work faster, more creatively, and more cost-efficiently. "
Doc680,Autodesk ,2001," So how exactly is Autodesk leading today??s digital design data and content revolution  In a word...literally.We??re making it easier for our customers to obtain, use, and benefit from our software to gain a competitive advantage. We??re moving from major releases to more frequent, more manageable modular enhancements. We??re moving from reseller-dominated sales to a more balanced blend of direct sales, resellers, and e-commerce. And we??re evolving from shrink-wrapped boxes to a mix of packaged applications and future-focused Internetdelivered services. "
Doc681,Autodesk ,2001," This year??s single objective was helping our customers connect throughout their value chains in important new ways. Autodesk conceived, engineered, and delivered a new generation of software that works the way our customers think, operating behind the scenes to make their work easier.Our new products work in conjunction with partner products, forming complete solutions that will enhance our customers?? business processes. And as the numbers prove, our customers are buying into the Autodesk vision. "
Doc682,Autodesk ,2001," Our success is our customers?? success. In fiscal year 2001,we put our Internet strategy in action and saw our vertical products take off as the demand for industry-specific applications increased.We continued to expand our network with spin-off companies and a new line of business. "
Doc683,Autodesk ,2001," The results are very positive. Our net revenues grew 10 percent to $936 million, and diluted earnings per share rose more than 88 percent to $1.87, excluding nonrecurring charges and amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles. Asia/Pacific revenues increased 22 percent to $207 million.The Americas reported revenue of $433 million an increase of 14 percent. European revenues of $296 million are consistent with last year??s figures. "
Doc684,Autodesk ,2001," Discreet and Design Solutions Segments The contribution of our world-renowned digital content creation division, Discreet,was impressive.The effects, animation, editing, and workflow solutions division posted revenues of $193 million that??s 21 percent of the year??s total net revenue and an 11 percent growth rate over last year. "
Doc685,Autodesk ,2001," Design Solutions which includes the Geographic Information Systems (GIS); Manufacturing; Architectural, Engineering, and Construction (AEC); and Design Platforms business divisions earned revenues of $743 million, accounting for nearly 80 percent of total net revenues. "
Doc686,Autodesk ,2001," The GIS division posted revenues of $98 million, up 37 percent from last year, the highest growth rate within Design Solutions. GIS growth is distributed across the product line from AutoCAD Map and AutoCAD Land Development Desktop to Autodesk MapGuide software. "
Doc687,Autodesk ,2001," The Manufacturing division grew 20 percent with sales of $134 million. It??s exciting and encouraging to see such strong customer adoption of our products, from Autodesk Mechanical Desktop and AutoCAD Mechanical to our new Autodesk Inventor 4. "
Doc688,Autodesk ,2001," AEC rode its flagship product, Autodesk Architectural Desktop, to revenue totaling $58 million for the year. "
Doc689,Autodesk ,2001," The Design Platforms division, with AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT software, provides a foundation for many products in the core design markets. Customers are clearly moving to specialized products in GIS,Manufacturing, and AEC groups experiencing strong growth to solve their industry-specific design challenges. The growth in our Design Platforms division slowed to 3 percent with revenues of $453 million while, as we planned, customers migrated to purpose-built products. "
Doc690,Autodesk ,2001," Even beyond our products, Autodesk business flourished.This year??s solid performance translated into a record amount of cash generated from operations at $196 million, an increase of 82 percent over the cash generated last year. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities equaled $423 million, even with expenditures of over $359 million for the repurchase of more than 9 million shares during the year. "
Doc691,Autodesk ,2001," Sound business strategy. Remarkable products. Dedicated employees.There??s more than one reason Autodesk thrived in 2001. Much of our success can be attributed to executing our three-part Internet strategy aimed at helping our customers compete in a wired world. First, we connected our core desktop applications to the Internet, making it easier for our users to take advantage of its boundless resources. We also developed new browser-based and mobile applications so customers can share ideas and creations with the World (Wide Web). And we focused on channeling the Web to provide more efficiency and collaboration. "
Doc692,Autodesk ,2001," Our engineering, sales, marketing, and operations teams mobilized this year to increase our value to customers and it??s working.New products such as Autodesk Inventor 4, Autodesk Architectural Desktop 3, and Discreet??s combustion have received kudos in their markets. All the products based on the AutoCAD 2000i platform, introduced mid-year, continue their momentum as the key to Internet-enabled collaborative design. And our user-friendly systems are making it easier than ever to use Autodesk software. "
Doc693,Autodesk ,2001, Our achievements in fiscal year 2001 include Discreet??s best year on record Internet-based design collaboration with the AutoCAD 2000i product line and Autodesk Point A design portal New versions of flagship products like Autodesk Inventor and Autodesk Architectural Desktop software that provide a new and better way to approach manufacturing and building-design projects Mobile and wireless initiatives like Autodesk OnSite and Autodesk Location Services to deliver information on-site and on time Driving revenue growth while tightly managing operations for maximum efficiency

Our future lies in successful products, like Autodesk Inventor, that are designed to improve the manufacturing chain from creation, through collaboration, to commerce. And Autodesk Streamline, our much-anticipated hosted collaborative product development solution, will let manufacturers use focused processes and instantly share personalized design information with whoever needs to see it.This online service will allow us to reach nearly five times more people, opening another revenue stream moving forward. "
Doc697,Autodesk ,2001," Architecture, Engineering, and Construction The move to the future can be intimidating and costly. Autodesk??s AEC strategy is to protect customers?? investments in existing data while making design information accessible and relevant throughout the building life cycle. Strong sales of Autodesk Architectural Desktop indicate that our robust object model technology is quickly gaining wide acceptance. This technology allows customers to collaborate in new ways, with new people, across the entire design-to-build process. "
Doc698,Autodesk ,2001," Design Platforms Imagine receiving the latest software upgrades throughout the year without disruptive installations.The Design Platforms group??s extension rollout strategy incorporates a subscription software delivery program to help customers using the AutoCAD platform stay competitive in the electronic world. With frequent, modular enhancements, our customers avoid major upgrades and always have the advantage of using the latest software just as soon as it becomes available. And it??s all made possible with Autodesk Point A, the web complement to our desktop software that seamlessly connects members to a world of information, product updates, services, and support. With more than 170,000 registered users, Point A far exceeds our first-year membership targets. "
Doc699,Autodesk ,2001," Autodesk Location Services In addition to our goal of reaching new customers across market-specific value chains, we are aggressively working to apply our technology expertise in new markets. Autodesk Location Services is our pioneer in the emerging market for delivery of location-sensitive information to wired and wireless devices. And with location-based services users expected to reach 450 million in the next three years, the upside is promising. "

Our roadmap for success Combining our vision of the future with the ability to execute on our goals in the present. While our ideas are revolutionary, our implementation has been incremental and evolutionary. This allows our customers to improve their business processes at a pace that is comfortable for them and, ultimately, profitable for you. "
Doc706,Autodesk ,2002," We keep our ideas in motion by staying focused on our customers?? present and future needs.We add the momentum of our strongest product line in 20 years. And most important,we deliver on the promises we make to our customers. So they trust us trust our motives.They know that while we continue to seek technology advances that meet the need for productivity and collaboration in the management and use of digital design and visual media,we haven??t forgotten the core creation business. "

Only Autodesk offers its customers the best return on investment of time, effort, and inspiration, helping them increase the value of digital designs and visual media across their entire business, and opening a whole world of possibilities. "
Doc708,Autodesk ,2002," In fiscal year 2002, despite a difficult economic environment, our financial results are solid. Our year-end net revenues improved 1 percent to $947 million, and diluted pro forma earnings per share, reflecting an April 2002 2-for-1 stock split, rose 14 percent to $1.06, excluding restructuring and other charges, amortization of goodwill, and a onetime gain.Without these pro forma adjustments, diluted earnings per share were 80 cents. Asia Pacific net revenues increased 7 percent to $223 million.The Americas reported net revenues of $433 million, equal to last year.And European net revenues of $291 million show only a slight decline over last year??s figures. "
Doc709,Autodesk ,2002," Our portfolio of businesses remained one of our most powerful assets.The strength of our portfolio lies in its diversity spanning industry segments, geographies, and customers ranging from global 1000 companies, to small and medium enterprises, to sole proprietorships. This diversity provides balance in our financial results. "
Doc710,Autodesk ,2002," The design solutions segment comprising primarily the Platform Technology Group and the Building Industry, Geographic Information Systems, and Manufacturing divisions earned net revenues of $791 million, representing growth of 6 percent and accounting for 84 percent of total net revenues.

Contributions were strong across the product line, from Autodesk Mechanical Desktop and AutoCAD Mechanical to our latest Autodesk Inventor 5. "
Doc714,Autodesk ,2002," The Platform Technology Group, with AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, continues to provide a foundation for many products in the core design markets. Net revenues for the group increased 2 percent over last year to $462 million. "
Doc715,Autodesk ,2002," Our moving media segment,Discreet, posted net revenues of $156 million, a 19 percent decline over last year, representing 16 percent of total net revenues. But while a slowdown in broadcast and film productions clearly inhibited Discreet??s financial performance, the Discreet product line continues to be the strongest in the market. "
Doc716,Autodesk ,2002," Looking past our product line,we see that this year has been about operational excellence and execution on our business model.This year??s solid performance generated cash from operations of $210 million, an increase of 7 percent over the cash generated last year. As of January 31, 2002,we see a strong balance sheet with cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $505 million and no long-term debt. "
Doc717,Autodesk ,2002," The goal at Autodesk remains simple but farreaching to give our customers the tools they need to harness their digital design and visual media data and turn it into something tangible, something real.Not just in the drafting room or the production studio but also across extended teams and along the entire value chain.We want to help customers get the most from their data by connecting every step of the process, from initial concepts and designs through the management and distribution of those assets. "
Doc718,Autodesk ,2002," This has had significant strategic implications, simplifying the complex processes customers use to engineer and manufacture products, design and construct buildings, develop and maintain infrastructure, and create and distribute visual media. And it has also reached down into, and radically altered, the fundamental processes that businesses use to create value and satisfy customers. "
Doc719,Autodesk ,2002," We had a number of significant achievements in fiscal year 2002, including the following: "
Doc720,Autodesk ,2002," Empowering design on the desktop: We shipped the AutoCAD 2002 family of products the strongest lineup of vertical applications in our history.We shipped Autodesk Inventor 5, which is now a sales leader in the mainstream 3D modeling market.We also shipped the strongest, most interoperable set of Discreet products ever.

Not just in the drafting room or production studio, but also across projects, throughout organizations, and around the world. "
Doc734,Autodesk ,2002," Of course,we couldn??t realize any of our successes without the contributions of those who support us.We work with great people: our customers, partners, resellers, developers, employees, and, of course, you. And we can??t thank you all enough for your part in making fiscal year 2002 one of undisputed success. "
Doc735,Autodesk ,2002," Last year,we told you that Autodesk was positioning itself to deliver real industry solutions solutions that fundamentally alter the complex processes our customers use to construct buildings,manufacture products, and create media-rich content to entertain the world.We delivered on that strategy, but we won??t rest on our laurels. As we celebrate our 20th anniversary, our promise for the next 20 years reflects our strengths and accomplishments over the last two decades.We??ll continue to help our customers create and make the most of the digital design data that powers their businesses and shapes our everyday landscape. Autodesk helping the world realize the power of design. "
Doc736,Autodesk ,2003,"Autodesk continued to build its leadership position in the design technology space in fiscal year 2003 through sound business practices and a strong portfolio of innovative, customer-centric products and services. Although the year was defined by a challenging global economic environment, Autodesk held its ground.We protected your investment in us by making careful decisions about how to run our business today, and by laying the groundwork for growth and success tomorrow. "
Doc737,Autodesk ,2003," During fiscal year 2003 the corporate spending environment in the industries we serve was the toughest we??ve seen in a long time. Even for products with rapid returns on investment (ROI) like ours, customers carefully scrutinized every purchase and reduced spending across the board.Despite the impact of worldwide economies on our revenues for the year, the overall health of the company remains strong.We experienced robust growth in China, our customers continued to migrate from 2D design to next-generation 3D technology, and our growing Subscription Program showed strong returns.We generated $86 million in cash from operating activities and have $411 million in cash and marketable securities.The investments we made in research and development of our products, programs, and initiatives, together with the advances we made around the world, have set the stage for us to extend our leadership position. "
Doc738,Autodesk ,2003," In fiscal 2003, nearly all our business divisions and geographies were adversely affected by the economy as customers tightened budgets and delayed purchases. Our year-end revenues totaled $825 million, down 13 percent from fiscal 2002. Because our operating margins are sensitive to reductions in sales revenues, this year??s revenue decline resulted in an operating margin of 3 percent of fiscal 2003 net revenue, compared to 10 percent in fiscal 2002. Pro forma diluted net income per share was $0.41. "
Doc739,Autodesk ,2003," As fiscal 2003 was a year focused on product development, revenues were clearly affected by fewer product releases.Many significant products either were released in late fiscal 2003 or will be released in the first half of fiscal 2004. As a result of our product cycle and the weak business environment, upgrade revenue from AutoCAD products in fiscal 2003 decreased to $69 million from $230 million a year ago. Despite the decrease in upgrade revenue,we saw strong growth in the success of our Subscription Program. A new way for existing customers to stay current with our software, the Subscription Program represented 21 percent of the total Americas Design Solutions Q4 revenue.Deferred revenue related to subscriptions grew to $57 million, an increase of more than 60 percent over fiscal 2002.The Subscription Program is one of our keys to creating a more predictable, recurring revenue stream. "
Doc740,Autodesk ,2003," As always,we ran our business prudently.We reacted quickly to the tough fiscal situation with cost-reduction efforts, including workforce and facilities reductions, no incentive bonus payouts, and mandatory time off for our employees.These measures helped us control our operating expenses and allowed us to remain profitable at recent levels of revenue. At the same time,we invested in growth initiatives for the future and also recruited and hired key senior management personnel. These talented executives will be integral to the growth of the company going forward. And once again Autodesk was named one of Fortune magazine??s 100 Best Companies to Work For a strong statement about our culture and our values. "
Doc741,Autodesk ,2003," Autodesk is divided into two business segments: the Design Solutions Group, which contains our core competency of design technology, and Discreet, our entertainment group. "
Doc742,Autodesk ,2003," Discreet From special effects at the movies to largerthan- life computer and console games, Discreet delivers digital content creation, visual effects, editing, and 3D streaming media applications.Net revenues for Discreet were $129 million in fiscal 2003 down 17 percent from $156 million last year. Sales were affected by the severe economic slowdown in the media, advertising, and entertainment sectors. Part of the decline was also due to the timing of our new product releases that shipped late in the year. As a result of lower sales figures, Discreet took action to scale its business to the reduced revenue level, lowering staff levels and operating costs. "
Doc743,Autodesk ,2003," The division launched important new versions of our advanced systems for high-end visual effects and editing.These releases including inferno, flame, and flint position Discreet well for success in fiscal 2004. For the eighth year in a row, the creators of all the nominees for the Academy Award for Visual Effects used Discreet??s visual effects compositing system, demonstrating Discreet??s wide adoption in its target industries. "
Doc744,Autodesk ,2003," Design Solutions Group Composed of the Platform Technology Division, the Manufacturing Solutions Division, the Building Solutions Division, and the Infrastructure Solutions Division (formerly known as the Geographic Information Systems Division), the Design Solutions Group (DSG) represented 84 percent of total net revenues in fiscal year 2003, or $696 million an annual decrease of 12 percent. "
Doc745,Autodesk ,2003," In fiscal 2003, DSG focused on developing great desktop design products and creating solutions to address lifecycle management of the data that customers create with our technologies. We know that for every person who creates digital design data, an estimated 7 to 10 people use that data downstream. Companies trying to improve efficiency are paying close attention to how data flows through their organizations.This represents a tremendous opportunity for Autodesk, because our solutions will help customers make the most of the ways they share and manage data. "
Doc746,Autodesk ,2003," PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY DIVISION AND OTHER Developer of AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT software, the Platform Technology Division (PTD) continues to provide a foundation for many products in the core design markets. In fiscal 2003, PTD focused its efforts on research and development of AutoCAD 2004 (released in Q1 of fiscal 2004), the fastest, easiest AutoCAD ever.Net revenues for this division were $401 million, off 13 percent from last year. "
Doc747,Autodesk ,2003," Feedback on the AutoCAD 2004 family of products ranges from positive to glowing. In addition, Autodesk??s Design Web Format (DWF), as well as the DWF-based Autodesk Express Viewer, are gaining widespread adoption as a smart and secure way to share critical design information across widely dispersed project teams.The free viewer has been downloaded more than a quarter million times in its first two months of availability, allowing users downstream to share digital design data more easily and laying the groundwork for Autodesk in the lifecycle management market. "
Doc748,Autodesk ,2003," MANUFACTURING SOLUTIONS DIVISION Companies in the manufacturing industry face a specific set of challenges: global markets and competition, mass-specialization, a tough macroeconomic environment, and, most basically, the need to reduce costs and accelerate time to market. With an array of products and services designed to deliver faster ROI and simplified product development, the Manufacturing Solutions Division (MSD) launched its strategy of bringing product lifecycle management (PLM) to the mainstream market. "
Doc749,Autodesk ,2003," Net revenues for MSD totaled $119 million, down 9 percent from the previous year, as customers tightened overall spending and specifically delayed technology purchases. The division made a strategic acquisition of truEInnovations, which has file and data management technology that will provide vaulting capabilities to our existing product line. Significant gains in MSD included over 150 percent growth of the installed base of the Autodesk Inventor Series, the flagship 3D modeling product in this division.Autodesk customer successes included expected reduced time to market of up to 70 percent for a leading lighting manufacturer and a worldwide tool manufacturer, with decreases in product development time of 40 percent. "
Doc750,Autodesk ,2003," The first quarter fiscal 2004 releases of Autodesk Inventor Series and Autodesk Streamline form the technology core of the Autodesk PLM offering, which addresses the need for affordable high-performance design and collaboration solutions for manufacturers competing in a global marketplace. "
Doc751,Autodesk ,2003," BUILDING SOLUTIONS DIVISION With compressed project times, complex processes, and widely dispersed project members, managing building information throughout the building lifecycle is becoming increasingly complex. In response, our Building Solutions Division (BSD) developed an aggressive strategy that will take us into the future.The acquisition of Revit in fiscal 2003 furthered our position, as this building design and documentation software moves our customers toward a building information modeling approach to building design. "
Doc752,Autodesk ,2003," Net revenues for BSD were $73 million, a decrease of 11 percent as customers worldwide were affected by decreased backlogs and business contractions when projects for commercial, institutional, and hospitality construction were canceled or deferred. "
Doc753,Autodesk ,2003," In fiscal 2004, Autodesk will continue to help its building industry customers move toward building information modeling and more efficient building lifecycle solutions with new releases of products such as Autodesk Architectural Desktop, Autodesk Building Systems, Autodesk Revit, and Autodesk Buzzsaw. "
Doc754,Autodesk ,2003," INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS DIVISION In fiscal 2003, our Infrastructure Solutions Division (ISD) offered a broad and complete set of solutions to create, analyze, and share data across key market sectors such as government, civil engineering, telecommunications, and utilities. Our technologies help users create maps, engineer structures, survey land, and analyze spatial data. "
Doc755,Autodesk ,2003," Net revenues for ISD were $103 million in fiscal 2003, a decrease of 11 percent. In addition to the impact of government budget crises, upheaval and restructuring in the telecommunications and utility industries caused critical customers to restrict spending.Yet ISD achieved some key milestones in fiscal 2003.The division delivered a strong release of Autodesk Map, made a strategic acquisition of CAiCE Software in the civil engineering and transportation arena, and turned in a solid performance in Asia with the recently localized Autodesk Land Desktop. "
Doc756,Autodesk ,2003," As global concerns about security continue to mount, companies and governments are growing ever more aware of infrastructure issues.Government budgets are being redeployed toward public safety and first responder projects, and Autodesk is expanding its leadership role as a provider of global infrastructure solutions. In fiscal 2004, Autodesk will launch new releases of virtually all ISD products, helping infrastructure management professionals get real-time access to geospatial information so that they can enter data once and retrieve it anytime, anywhere. "
Doc757,Autodesk ,2003," Geographies Our Americas region continued to lead sales in fiscal year 2003, producing $374 million in revenue, a decrease of 14 percent from fiscal 2002. Our Europe,Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region generated revenues of $263 million, a decrease of 9 percent from the previous year. Our Asia Pacific region continued to suffer the strongest negative effects of the difficult economy, as revenues decreased 16 percent to $187 million. Contrary to other trends in Asia, China posted impressive results. While still a developing market, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 revenue in China grew 40 percent sequentially, and in the same quarter AutoCAD revenue in China was second in the world. "
Doc758,Autodesk ,2003," Looking beyond our geographies and strong product line,we have an efficient business model capable of supporting investments as well as increased revenue levels and profitability. "
Doc759,Autodesk ,2003," A key component of our business model is our positive cash flow, even in the midst of an industry slowdown.We generated more than $86 million in cash from operations in fiscal year 2003, and this continues to be a significant competitive advantage for Autodesk. "
Doc760,Autodesk ,2003," We also have a strong balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities equaled $411 million, even with acquisitions totaling $145 million, stock repurchases of $65 million, and dividends of $14 million. Furthermore,we have no long-term debt. "
Doc761,Autodesk ,2003," Overall, fiscal 2003 was a tough year, but our investments in product development and our ability to generate cash remain key differentiators between Autodesk and its competition. "
Doc762,Autodesk ,2003," Our customers identify Autodesk with innovation. As part of our plan to extend Autodesk??s technology leadership into the next decade,we are developing several key growth initiatives in markets that we believe have excellent potential: "
Doc763,Autodesk ,2003," LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT: In fiscal 2003,we began to focus efforts throughout our divisions on developing lifecycle management solutions that offer customers significant improvements to their critical business processes. For example, Autodesk Buzzsaw, a component of building lifecycle management, now has 73,000 users, proving that online collaboration is the right solution for the building industry.We??ll continue to extend our investment and build on our progress in lifecycle management. "
Doc764,Autodesk ,2003," AUTODESK LOCATION SERVICES: Through our Location Services Division we provide technology to wireless carriers to develop and deploy location-based services that will drive data services, build customer loyalty, and increase customer usage. Our complete location solution allows carriers to quickly and easily develop and deploy customized applications or to location-enable existing services. Autodesk Location Services has engaged in several trials with operators in the U.S. and EMEA, whose combined subscriber base is more than 25 million users. "
Doc765,Autodesk ,2003," DESKTOP VIDEO: The rapidly increasing number of professionals using video on their desktop makes this a compelling new market. Discreet??s fiscal 2003 releases of its streaming media encoding product, cleaner XL, together with the latest version of combustion, form a great foundation for Discreet as it pursues this growth opportunity. "
Doc766,Autodesk ,2003," These initiatives represent strategic, forwardthinking resource investments that we believe will position Autodesk in key growth areas. Interest in and demand for these nextgeneration concepts is growing. Continuing our tradition of innovating and mainstreaming technology, Autodesk will be ready to deliver future products and services in these areas. "
Doc767,Autodesk ,2003," Customer-Centric Focus In an effort to become even more customercentric, we vertically aligned our sales and professional services organizations with our customers?? industries and our own product divisions.This vertical reorganization has three major elements: "
Doc768,Autodesk ,2003, Making the customer the centerpiece of all our decision making 
Doc769,Autodesk ,2003, Aligning our newly structured vertical sales force with our product divisions 
Doc770,Autodesk ,2003, Moving toward a solutions-focused sales approach that will help Autodesk succeed in the lifecycle management space 
Doc771,Autodesk ,2003," The realignment is enabling all of Autodesk to develop and market the technologies our customers count on us for, and at the same time create the lifecycle management solutions we believe are part of our future. "
Doc772,Autodesk ,2003," Looking ahead to the next year and beyond, I believe that Autodesk has never been as well-positioned for future growth and success as it is today. "
Doc773,Autodesk ,2003," In these challenging times, customers are looking for innovative ways to do more with less. In response, by Q2 of fiscal 2004 we will have released robust new versions of all our major products.This product portfolio is the strongest in our 20-year history.We??ll be marketing product and service solutions that are quick to implement and improve our customers?? time to market.We believe these offerings will bolster Autodesk??s position as a solution provider and partner. Our unique combination of worldclass products and services, solutions-focused approach, and customer-centric alignment puts us in an extremely strong position in the lifecycle management arena. "
Doc774,Autodesk ,2003," Of course,we couldn??t have accomplished what we did in the past year without the contributions of those who support our efforts here at Autodesk: our customers, partners, resellers, developers, employees, and, of course, our investors. "
Doc775,Autodesk ,2003," We??d also like to recognize the contribution made by Paul Otellini during his tenure on the Board of Directors. As a measure of our appreciation, the Board has given the title Director Emeritus to Paul, who will not stand for reelection at this year??s Annual Meeting. "
Doc776,Autodesk ,2003," So whether we??re helping an inspired engineer design and create an innovative new product or enabling a special-effects artist to bring home an Academy Award for dazzling digital images, Autodesk will be right there supporting our customers in their great work and justifying the confidence you??ve shown by investing in us. "
Doc777,Autodesk ,2004,I??m delighted to be the bearer of good news we??ve had an outstanding year! 
Doc778,Autodesk ,2004," In an uncertain economic environment, our revenues increased steadily throughout the year. How did we do it Many factors contributed to our success. But the single overriding reason is that our products are fabulous. "
Doc779,Autodesk ,2004," Quite simply, Autodesk makes terrific products that contribute tangible value to our customers with significant productivity increases and quick return on investment. Creating and continuously improving great products is the foundation that supports our success in every area. As we discussed in last year??s report, fiscal 2003 marked a concentrated focus on product development. Fiscal 2004 witnessed the payoff of that effort. "
Doc780,Autodesk ,2004," Our customers?? voices are at the heart of our product development. This year we incorporated their feedback as never before, seeking their input in focus groups, beta programs, user group meetings and face-to-face visits at customer sites. And we expanded these events to locations around the world, gathering feedback that reflects the interests of our European and Asian customers. "
Doc781,Autodesk ,2004," Our planned release cycle for AutoCAD-based products formerly 18 to 24 months is now 12 months. The shortened cycle provides customers with more frequent gains in functionality and productivity, while reducing the revenue volatility that we have experienced in the past. By releasing new products and retiring others each year, we??re decreasing the impact of product cycles on our financial performance. Also contributing to the predictability of revenues is the continued momentum of our Subscription program. Customers are increasingly embracing the added value of this offering, which enhances their productivity and return on investment. "
Doc782,Autodesk ,2004, Our financial performance demonstrates that our strategy is working. Our customers like what they see. 
Doc783,Autodesk ,2004," Our financial goals for fiscal 2004 were to drive revenue growth, increase revenue predictability and improve profitability. In a year overshadowed by an economy in transition, we met our goals, and Autodesk flourished. Our strong performance was driven by continued strength in revenue from new users, a significant increase in upgrades and the ongoing success of the company??s Subscription program. "
Doc784,Autodesk ,2004," In summary, net revenue for fiscal 2004 was $952 million, an increase of 15 percent compared with $825 million in fiscal 2003. Net income for fiscal 2004 was $120 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, including a $3 million restructuring charge and the positive effects of tax settlements totaling $27 million. Net income in fiscal 2003 was $32 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, including $26 million in restructuring charges and the positive effect of tax benefits of $4 million. Our operating margin increased 8 percentage points over fiscal 2003 to 11 percent. "
Doc785,Autodesk ,2004," Our revenue growth was driven by strong new releases of all major products during the year, putting us in a good position when the worldwide economy began to recover. As our customers saw new strength in their businesses, they began spending again, first upgrading existing licenses and then buying new ones. In fact, our upgrade revenue grew 88 percent over fiscal 2003. "
Doc786,Autodesk ,2004," With the economic recovery as a backdrop, we saw growth in all geographies and all divisions in fiscal 2004. The Americas experienced strong revenue growth, increasing 9 percent over fiscal 2003 to $410 million. Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) had an outstanding year, with revenue growing 28 percent year over year, to $337 million. We saw improvement in most major economies in EMEA, and Germany appeared to have halted its economic decline. Asia Pacific revenues followed suit, increasing 9 percent year over year to $205 million, despite a midyear slowdown due to SARS. We??re happy to report particular strength in Japan, where the economy has been picking up since the middle of the year. Foreign exchange rates also provided substantial benefit during the year. "
Doc787,Autodesk ,2004," Divisional Review Our business is organized into two segments: the Design Solutions Group, encompassing Autodesk??s core competency of design technology applications, and Discreet, our media and entertainment group. "
Doc788,Autodesk ,2004," DESIGN SOLUTIONS GROUP Revenues for our Design Solutions Group (DSG) comprising the Platform Technology Division, Manufacturing Solutions Division, Infrastructure Solutions Division and Building Solutions Division reached $812 million this year, an increase of 17 percent over fiscal 2003.

Revenues from our Subscription program reached 14 percent of DSG revenues for the year, marking substantial progress toward our goal of subscriptions amounting to 25 to 30 percent of total DSG revenues. "
Doc789,Autodesk ,2004," The Platform Technology Division (PTD) showed solid growth, with revenues of $477 million, an increase of 20 percent compared with last year. AutoCAD revenues increased 26 percent over the previous year, with strong growth in new licenses and upgrades. "
Doc790,Autodesk ,2004," The Manufacturing Solutions Division (MSD) posted revenues of $140 million, an increase of 17 percent compared with last year. Once again, Autodesk Inventor Series was the best-selling 3D manufacturing design software in the marketplace. "
Doc791,Autodesk ,2004," The Infrastructure Solutions Division (ISD) also turned in an excellent performance. Revenues increased 12 percent over the previous year to $115 million. ISD saw particular strength in the civil engineering market, offering the only civil engineering solutions with tools for every task of the project lifecycle. "
Doc792,Autodesk ,2004," The Building Solutions Division (BSD) finished the year strongly with a 9 percent increase in revenues to $80 million, despite continued slow spending in commercial construction worldwide. "
Doc793,Autodesk ,2004," DISCREET Discreet, our entertainment group, made an impressive comeback with a 9 percent revenue increase over fiscal 2003 to $140 million. Discreet??s powerful products, coupled with the return of spending in the critical advertising market, drove strong performance. "
Doc794,Autodesk ,2004," IMPROVING PROFITABILITY This year we took a hard look at our cost structure and saw room for significant improvement. We benchmarked our cost structure against that of other companies in our industry, using the results to implement productivity initiatives and set short- and long-term productivity targets throughout the company. We are already reaping the benefits of these actions our operating margin has increased 8 percentage points over fiscal 2003 to 11 percent and we are committed to making substantial improvements in this area in the coming year. "
Doc795,Autodesk ,2004," STRONG BALANCE SHEET Autodesk is well positioned financially. Our strong sales generated significant cash flow this year. In fact, in 2004 we generated $220 million in operating cash flow. We used $13 million for our regular quarterly dividend, $178 million for our share repurchase program and $5 million related to mergers and acquisitions in growth initiatives. Yet with all those programs, we still ended the year with a strong balance sheet: we have $530 million in cash and marketable securities and no debt. "
Doc796,Autodesk ,2004," Great products. Increased predictability of revenues. Dedication to profitability. Every product enhancement, every new release, every decision we made reflects our strategic commitment to better products, more predictable revenues and increased profitability. Our product cycles are now the shortest they??ve ever been, with new versions of all our products released each fiscal year. The enhanced release cycles worked in tandem with our Subscription model to provide an increasingly predictable flow of revenues. "
Doc797,Autodesk ,2004, Notable highlights of this landmark year include the following: 
Doc798,Autodesk ,2004," Launch of the strongest suite of products in our history, including the AutoCAD 2004 family of products, Autodesk Inventor 8, Autodesk Inventor Professional 8, Autodesk Revit 6, 3ds max 6 and lustre, our new system for digital grading and color correction "

Doc805,Autodesk ,2004," We continue making the customer the center of all our decision making. Furthering initiatives begun last year, we??ve vertically aligned our sales and professional services organizations with our customers?? industries and with our own product divisions. Our customers?? needs are the driving force behind the lifecycle management vision that is a vital component of our success strategy. "
Doc806,Autodesk ,2004," Discreet serves customers who create highvalue, design-intensive content such as effects-rich feature films, premier programming, television commercials and interactive gaming. We also help them simplify their processes by providing integrated workflow solutions that go beyond the creation of digital media assets to include storage, management and distribution. "
Doc807,Autodesk ,2004," Our customers recognize the importance of digital workflow in driving their own efficiency and profitability, and Discreet provides the award-winning technology to do that. Discreet??s inferno, flame, fire and lustre systems are the industry??s leading technologies, enabling visual artists to create content once and use it anywhere, from start to finish. 3ds max Discreet??s industry-leading modeling, animation and rendering software is used by the world??s top 3D artists and designers to create eye-catching visual effects, cutting-edge games and unique design visualizations. "
Doc808,Autodesk ,2004," Design Solutions Group Our DSG customers can never get enough performance. Performance improvements deliver increased productivity and profitability to users, and give them a competitive advantage. In fiscal 2004, we shipped new releases for our entire family of AutoCAD products one of our most successful releases ever as well as all other major products, including Autodesk Inventor Series and Autodesk AutoCAD Revit Series. We also released several new strategic products during the year, such as Autodesk Inventor Professional and AutoCAD Electrical and the important new Autodesk Vault functionality.

Doc809,Autodesk ,2004," Platform Technology Division: In our continuing commitment to providing even better software, we listened to our customers?? feedback and suggestions to create product releases with improved functionality, such as smaller file sizes, quicker file opening and closing, faster design creation and easier file sharing. And customer feedback has already provided the road map for upcoming releases over the next three to four years. "
Doc810,Autodesk ,2004," Manufacturing Solutions Division: In fiscal 2004, we strengthened our position as the industry leader in this critical market. Autodesk Inventor Series was the bestselling 3D manufacturing software for the third straight year. To extend its power, we released Autodesk Inventor Professional, which provides additional functionality. Less than 20 percent of our manufacturing customers currently use 3D, so there is a significant growth opportunity for this division. "
Doc811,Autodesk ,2004," Infrastructure Solutions Division: ISD saw growth in all geographies and all markets transportation, civil engineering and infrastructure management and record growth in all sectors of government as budgets were increasingly redeployed toward public safety and first-responder projects. As promised last year, fiscal 2004 saw new releases of virtually all ISD products, including Autodesk Map, Autodesk Land Desktop, Autodesk Civil Design, Autodesk Survey, Autodesk Raster Design and the new and strategically important Autodesk Civil 3D. "
Doc812,Autodesk ,2004," Building Solutions Division: Today??s fast-track construction projects demand speed and depend on the contributions of people all around the world. In tandem with the launch of AutoCAD 2004, BSD released a strong new version of Autodesk Architectural Desktop, providing full support for importing, exporting and linking files. Our strategy of moving building customers to the building information model was enhanced in 2004 with the introduction of Autodesk AutoCAD Revit Series, which, like Autodesk Inventor Series, enables customers to migrate to 3D at their own pace. "
Doc813,Autodesk ,2004," In fiscal 2004, Autodesk products continued to stand at the crossroads of technology and creativity but we weren??t standing still. Any idea that our customers can imagine can be designed, built or manufactured using Autodesk products. And to take Autodesk products, and Autodesk, to the next level, we set the following key growth initiatives for fiscal 2004 and beyond: "
Doc814,Autodesk ,2004," Stronger Design Tools: As we improve the performance and functionality of current products with each new release, we are also developing products that address industry-specific needs. "
Doc815,Autodesk ,2004," Expanded Lifecycle Management: The effective management and tracking of complex project data throughout the project cycle is an area of strategic importance to customers in all our markets and a longterm initiative for us. We??re investing in this initiative across all divisions. During fiscal 2004, we introduced Autodesk Vault, a data management solution that enables fast, accurate sharing of design data among engineering and manufacturing teams. "
Doc816,Autodesk ,2004," Greater Geographic Coverage: Geographically based initiatives are a key element of our growth strategy. Our new China Development Center is the most significant example, providing a deeper understanding of local markets while developing products to specifically address the Chinese market. "
Doc817,Autodesk ,2004," In my letter last year, I said I believed that Autodesk had never been so well positioned for future growth. That was true then, and it continues to hold true as we embark on fiscal year 2005. Our product line has never been better. Last year, we anticipated the release of powerful new versions of all our major products. We delivered on that expectation, and in fiscal 2005 we have significant new releases of all major products coming out at the same time as last year, or earlier. In fact, as you read this report, we have already started shipping the AutoCAD 2005 family of products. "
Doc818,Autodesk ,2004," We also plan to introduce several significant new products, including the important new release of Autodesk Civil 3D for our infrastructure customers and new Linux-based releases for our media customers. We have just begun our restructuring efforts and remain firmly committed to improving profitability. We??re on track to perform and execute. In short, I have never been more enthusiastic as we head into a new fiscal year. My optimism is based on several key factors: "
Doc819,Autodesk ,2004, Our strategy is working: Autodesk products are the worldwide design standard. The move to 3D represents enormous revenue growth opportunity with significantly higher average selling prices. 
Doc820,Autodesk ,2004, Our product portfolio has never been stronger. Our planned annual product release cycle focuses on thematic releases that provide significant improvements in functionality and integration. 
Doc821,Autodesk ,2004, Our Subscription program continues to be successful and is an integral component in our strategy for improving the predictability of our business model. 
Doc822,Autodesk ,2004," Our move into lifecycle management is creating new and exciting opportunities for us. We??ll continue improving and delivering design creation, management and collaboration solutions that offer our customers significant improvements to their critical business processes. "
Doc823,Autodesk ,2004," The worldwide economy is showing improvement, with the United States and Japan looking particularly strong. We have a great growth strategy that??s bearing fruit and another fantastic product year ahead of us. We??re moving to a stronger and more profitable business model. We have good reason for optimism as we head into a new fiscal year. "
Doc824,Autodesk ,2004," Fiscal 2004 was a great year. Thank you. Thank you to our investors, employees, partners and customers for your contributions and support. We couldn??t have done it without you. And I hope you??ll join us as we continue to seek new opportunities to deliver the innovation and leadership our customers count on. "
Doc825,Citrix ,1996,"1996 was an excellent year for Citrix. We made significant strides in our journey toward buillling a world-class company. It has been a tremendous team effort and we would like to thank everyone in the Citrix family-stockholders, employees, customers, OEMs, resellers and strategic partners. "
Doc826,Citrix ,1996, Our 1996 financial results reflect the success of our effort Revenue grew to $44.5 million- over three times our 1995 revenue of $14.6 million. Our net income of $18.7 million exceeded our 1995 net income of $1.9 million by a factor of nine. Our growth during 1996 further validated the value of our products and our innovative thin client/server computing architecture. 
Doc827,Citrix ,1996," Our product, technology, sales and support strategies meshed well in 1996. The new release of Citrix WinFrame 1.6 was an immediate success and established us as a market leader in extending the reach of business-critical applications The increased acceptance of our ICA protocol by some of the most respected OEMs in the industry helped us in our goal of establishing ICA as a de facto industry standard for thin-client/server computing. The worldwide expansion of our exciting channel program-the Citrix Solutions Network-to over 1,400 systems integrators and value-added resellers allowed us to reach more customers than ever with our selling messages. And the expansion of our technical support and systems engineering capabilities improved our ability to provide more customer-focused services. "
Doc828,Citrix ,1996," The demand for our products has generated sigificant interest from OEMs and co-marketing partners throughout the world. Through the end of 1996, we have signed many co-marketing agreements with leading hardware and software companies through the Citrix Business Alliance program. "
Doc829,Citrix ,1996," The overall migration to 32-bit enterprise applications continues to create substantial market opportunities. Our customers want cost-effective, flexible access to powerful applications now. "
Doc830,Citrix ,1996," That??s exactly what we offer through our WinFrame product family that includes our ovim ICA and MULTIWIN technologies. We enable widely diverse groups such as DOS, UNDQ, X terminal, Macintosh, Windows terminal, network computer and even wireless PDA users to access business- critical applications, from virtually anywhere, via any connection. "
Doc831,Citrix ,1996," Even with the positive background of 1996, we face many substantial challenges in 1997. As we write this letter, Microsoft has announced its intention to incorporate multi-user and additional remote access capabilities in a future version of Windows NT. While we believe this announcement validates our vision for distributed enterprise computing, we also recognize the critical importance of Microsoft??s plans to our future. As reported, we have been engaged in cross-licensing negotiations with Microsoft for future products. While there can be no assurance that an agreement will be reached, we remain committed to executing our long-term strategy for enterprise computing. "
Doc832,Citrix ,1996," We believe our unique technologies and product offerings help companies lower their total cost of application ownership by enabling applications and support to be deployed and managed from a single point. And, we intend to continue opening the doors for existing computers and new devices to access the latest strategic applications all without sacrificing performance. "
Doc833,Citrix ,1996," At Citrix, our products and technologies are rapidly becoming an accepted I/S solution for thin-client/server enterprise computing. Together, we intend to build an innovative, successful World-class company that takes computing even further "
Doc834,Citrix ,1997,"the year 1997 was incredibly good for Citrix. Here??s a sincere thanks to the extended Citrix family stockholders, employees, customers, OEMs, resellers and alliance marketing partners - for a great team effort. "
Doc835,Citrix ,1997," We grew our 1997 revenue to $123.9 million a 178% increase over our 1996 revenue of $44.5 million. Our after-tax profit grew 121% to a record $41.3 million and we achieved new milestones in our journey toward building a world-class company. Synergistic industry and market trends in enterprise computing, as well as increasing customer recognition of the value in our thin-client/server products, fueled our growth. "
Doc836,Citrix ,1997," Existing customers found new ways to extend the use of our products and new customers were able to get the lower cost and faster deployment benefits; from our thin-client/server computing approach. By the end of 1997, over one million concurrent user connections were in use. Our 1997 growth is solid evidence that our vision for application deployment and management software is solving important computing problems for enterprise customers worldwide. "
Doc837,Citrix ,1997," Managing our growth continues to be one of our most important priorities. During 1997 we added over 150 new employees and expanded our internal systems and facilities to provide a top-notch business environment for our most precious asset-our people. Our recently announced acquisition of technologies from Insignia Solutions in February 1998 added over 40 people to our new R&D center just west of London, England. 1997 was marked by growth in every Citrix organization as we attracted strong, experienced new people to the company while continuing to maintain our core values. Our October 1997 acquisition of Sydney, Australia-based Datapac helped us accelerate our move into the Asia-Pacific market while also providing new technologies for future products. "
Doc838,Citrix ,1997," Providing high-performance, universal access to 32-bit enterprise applications to any desktop over any network continues to be the core message that drives adoption of our products. In order to accelerate the delivery of this message and increase: the adoption of thin-client/server computing, we doubled the Citrix Solutions Network channel to almost 3,000 Solution providers. We also doubled the number of industry vendors in the Citrix Business Alliance program, including an exciting, new strategic relationship with Compaq Computer Corporation. "
Doc839,Citrix ,1997," We achieved excellent results in our ??ICA Everywhere?? program. New ICA licensees such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard and UMAX, for example, mean a broad range of new information appliances will extend the promise of thin-client/server computing even further. "
Doc840,Citrix ,1997," On May 9, 1997, we entered a technology licensing and joint development agreement with Microsoft to build new server-based platforms on upcoming versions of Windows NT?? Server that can yield up to $175 million in revenue to Citrix over five years. The first of these products the Microsoft Windows-based Terminal Server is expected to be available in mid-1998. Our work with Microsoft is validating our vision for thin-client/server computing, Co-marketing with Microsoft has the potential to accelerate customer awareness of our existing and new products. "
Doc841,Citrix ,1997," In june, 1997, we announced a development project that we code-named ??plCAsso??. Later in 1998, products from this effort will allow our customers to create robust, thin-client/server systems on top of the new Microsoft Windows-based Terminal Server software. The addition of new technology offerings from the ??plCAsso?? Project means our sales channels will be able to offer additional thin-client/server solutions for an even broader range of enterprise application deployment needs. "
Doc842,Citrix ,1997," Our thin-client/server architecture has the potential to provide powerful enterprise computing solutions to millions of users Windows PCs to Macintosh?? computers, DOS computers, UNIX?? workstations, network computers and Windows-based Terminals. Market opportunities abound. Our financial strength, overall product acceptance and growth plans make us well positioned to tap market potential. While we continue to face challenges, we intend to continue to provide the most robust products and services for enterprise application deployment. "
Doc843,Citrix ,1997, Our desire to build a world-class company is greater than ever. Thank you for working with us as an integral part of the Citrix family. 
Doc844,Citrix ,1998,"There is only one word to describe 1998 fantastic! It was another year of tremendous growth for Citrix and we thank you for your support and commitment in sharing our vision for the future of server-based computing. We??re proud of the great performances turned in by our employees, OEMs, resellers and industry alliances. "
Doc845,Citrix ,1998," We enjoyed growth in every area in 1998, and our financial results show it. Net revenue increased by 101% over 1997 to $248.6 million. Aggressive global expansion led to a 204% growth in international business over 1997. Profitability was also solid with a growth of 76% in earnings per share to $0.94 excluding write-offs from acquisitions and amortization of intangibles. The year ended with a stronger-than-ever balance sheet that gives us the financial foundation we need to continue expanding the market for our enterprise and software products. "
Doc846,Citrix ,1998," We believe that server-based computing is one of the largest and most dynamic new technology markets in evolution today. In fact, we estimate that in 1998 the server-based computing market grew to over one billion dollars for hardware, software and services twofold growth over 1997. We saw evidence of this market growth last September when we hosted Thinergy, the first conference for server-based computing. This event captured the hearts and minds of more than 2,000 customers, resellers and alliance members, and further demonstrated our leadership role in the evolving server-based computing market. "
Doc847,Citrix ,1998," To capitalize on the potential of this market opportunity, we expanded our entire business infrastructure and opened new development facilities in Redmond and Salt Lake City. We also opened new operations in London, Cambridge, Munich, Paris and Tokyo increasing our workforce to more than 600 professionals worldwide. "
Doc848,Citrix ,1998," New products, more alliances and a larger worldwide sales channel, fueled our growth in 1998. We introduced new server-based computing software, MetaFrame??, which was heralded with critical acclaim and quickly became our flagship product. We also forged expanded relationships with some of the most prestigious organizations in the world, including KPMG, Andersen Consulting, MCI Worldcom, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte & Touche, IBM Global Services and Siemens AG. In addition, our award-winning Citrix Solutions Network reseller program grew to a global force of more than 4,500 certified systems integrators. "
Doc849,Citrix ,1998," In 1998, we acquired new technologies and talent to help create powerful enhancements to our existing products and exciting new products that will bring video and Java?? application capabilities to our system. These acquisitions will be essential to continuing our value-added product plans for the Windows NT?? Server operating system. And through our alliance with Microsoft, Windows?? 2000 will present Citrix with new opportunities to provide more enhanced server-based computing solutions. "
Doc850,Citrix ,1998," We continued to garner very positive feedback from customers, resellers, industry alliances and investors throughout the year, and were proud recipients of many awards acknowledging our company performance, product vision and alliance programs. We were especially honored when we were added to the NASDAQ 100 and S&P 400 indices during 1998. "
Doc851,Citrix ,1998," Our customers were also big winners in 1998. They leveraged more value from their existing computing infrastructures and rolled out new applications and software updates in record times. Our commitment to our customers is simple: We will build the software they need to deploy, access and manage applications in any computing environment. "
Doc852,Citrix ,1998," Citrix had a great year in 1998, and we??re well-positioned to have an even stronger 1999. Thank you for working with us as an integral part of the Citrix family. "
Doc853,Citrix ,1999,"It all began with an idea: the idea that hosting and managing applications on a server would enable exciting new possibilities for information access. lt??s a deceptively simple notion, but a truly profound one that forms the basis for an easier, faster and broader world of computing a world where you can easily access any application with any dance, over any network. lt??s a world that requires digital independence to make accessing information and interacting with applications as easy as making a phone call. "
Doc854,Citrix ,1999," While Citrix has certainly evolved over the course of our first decade, we are still as committed to that original idea as ever as we look to extend our position as a world leader in application serving. "
Doc855,Citrix ,1999," We believe the application serving marker we pioneered is one of the most exciting and promising markets in all of information technology, Of everyone on this planet, more than two and a half billion people have yet to ??get connected-  through the Internet or otherwise- and become part of the information society. Application serving has the potential to change that. The need for quick and easy access to everything computing can offer is driving demand for a new form of global democracy: ??information citirenship for all. As people become more mobile and increasingly savvy about communicating in new ways with cell phones, palmtops and other wireless devices, traditional thinking about ??computing?? is giving way to new visions of information access at work, at home and at play. Application serving will make these visions real "
Doc856,Citrix ,1999," All of this is good news for Citrix, as we are at the nerve center of these new information paradigms that will dominate the new millennium. The Citrix brand has long stood for application serving, and we boast the most impressive array of customers in the application-serving space all 100 of the Fortune 100. "
Doc857,Citrix ,1999, Our aim is to offer the broadest set of products for providing access to any application in the world-from Windows?? to UNIX?? to java?? and Web application- so customers can implement their e-business systems at digital speed. 
Doc858,Citrix ,1999," To a large extent, meeting customer needs in these evolutionary times means enhancing our already established position as a key infrastructure provider for application service providers, or ASPS. We are focused on delivering our ASP and other customers connect and compute application access through a Web browser, and we recently took our first strides in this direction with our new Citrix NFuse??' application portal product. Some of our most exciting new product efforts are targeted at extending our powerful application server solutions beyond our existing Windows, UNIX, java and video application offerings to Web-based applications, which we intend to make as rich in functionality and interactivity as traditional PC-based applications. We are also developing a robust set of value-added management tools that will allow our customers to provide superior application service levels to their subscribers. And as a framework for these product offerings, we are working in concert with our system integration partners to provide best-practices consulting services, education and technical support that is resulting in new levels of customer excellence "
Doc859,Citrix ,1999," The timing is perfect for Citrix to extend our well-established position in the application-serving market, and we are moving aggressively to invest more rapidly in the business. The e-business worlds of Web commerce and ASPs are exploding, and we are moving at digital speed to become a strategic vendor in these markers. We are leveraging our strong balance sheet and healthy financial standing to open up new markets for our solutions and new products for our customers. We are aggressively growing our employee capabilities, infrastructure systems and operating practices to effectively meet out potential. "
Doc860,Citrix ,1999," All of this promising future is a natural outgrowth from the great year we had in 1999. revenue was up 62 percent over 1998, and net income increased to 140 million or 1.35 per share. but excellent financial performance tells only a part of the Citrix story. We introduced Citrix MetaFrame and our first server-level management products in 1999, and we acquired ViewSoft to integrate important Web application serving technology into our product line. And during 1999 we exapnded our global geographic footprint established our role in the emerging ASP market through our business initiatives and launched our digital independence branding. "
Doc861,Citrix ,1999," the best thing about our recent accomplishments is that they are only a beginning. As we continue to build upon that simple, but visionary idea from more than a decade ago, we are excited by the possibilities of new technologies, new products and new markets for application serving infrastructure. we thank all of our dedicated investors, customers and employees for joining us on this fantastic voyage. and we invite you to continue with us as we forge aggressively into our second decade. "
Doc862,Citrix ,2000,Fiscal 2000 was clearly a year of challenge and change for both Citrix and the technology market. Throughout this dynamic year we stayed the course by delivering world-class application serving solutions that met our customers?? needs to simplify the complexity and reduce the cost of deploying and managing information. 
Doc863,Citrix ,2000," Customer response to our products and services continued to prove the value of Citrix offerings during 2000, as we increased net revenue more than $67 million for the year.While we did not make the growth progress we had hoped for,we believe we made a strong showing in 2000 and are well positioned to make positive strides in 2001. "
Doc864,Citrix ,2000, There were many important milestones in 2000 that we believe position us for success in the future: 
Doc865,Citrix ,2000," Delivery of the first Citrix?? MetaFrame?? feature release along with an enhanced version of our Citrix NFuse??, application portal software. "
Doc866,Citrix ,2000," Delivery of a new product, Citrix Extranet??, designed to meet the all-important need for secure application access over public networks such as the Internet. "
Doc867,Citrix ,2000," Extension of the Citrix MetaFrame family to three UNIX?? platforms: Sun?? Solaris??, IBM?? AIX?? and HP-UX??. "
Doc868,Citrix ,2000, A release of Citrix MetaFrame that enabled early adopters of the Microsoft??Windows?? 2000 platform to continue receiving the additional value and benefits of Citrix application serving and management software capabilities. 
Doc869,Citrix ,2000, The year also included significant business expansion and development: 
Doc870,Citrix ,2000," We acquired the Innovex Group, Inc., which forms the core of Citrix Consulting Services (CCS). CCS augments our ability to effectively meet customer needs for fully integrated application serving solutions, in addition to application serving products. "
Doc871,Citrix ,2000," We continued to build our overall global presence with expansion efforts in a variety of regions such as Hong Kong, India and Latin America. "
Doc872,Citrix ,2000," We added more top professionals to the ranks of Citrix including a new CIO bringing the employee total at year??s end to 1,398. "
Doc873,Citrix ,2000, The year was further highlighted by major successes with customers and partners: 
Doc874,Citrix ,2000, We surpassed 24 million end users of our Independent Computing Architecture (ICA??) technology. 
Doc875,Citrix ,2000, We announced ASP (application service provider) partnership agreements with IBM and BT (British Telecom). 
Doc876,Citrix ,2000," We announced Web Enterprise Information Portal (EIP) licensing agreements with both Yahoo! and mySAP.com??, followed later by similar announcements with a virtual ??Who??s Who?? in the EIP world Brio, Epicentric, Plumtree, Sequoia, Top Tier and Viador. "
Doc877,Citrix ,2000, We signed a major systems integrator agreement with Compaq to sell Citrix software on its servers and provide professional services support. 
Doc878,Citrix ,2000," We successfully demonstrated our Project Vertigo technology with several of our major partners, including Microsoft. "
Doc879,Citrix ,2000," In all, we believe these highlights from 2000 demonstrate how we continued to grow our product lines, to expand our geographic reach, to build stronger business relationships with key industry players and to develop a Web strategy that positions us well as that market space matures and grows. "
Doc880,Citrix ,2000," As we enter into FY2001, Citrix continues to be a global leader in application serving. We are building on the successes established during our first decade with a focus on: "
Doc881,Citrix ,2000," Growing our ability to better meet customer needs by developing new channels, new partners and broader capabilities that will enable us to play a deeper and more significant role in our customers?? businesses. "
Doc882,Citrix ,2000," Providing new product offerings, world-class service and support, and innovative licensing programs that help us continue meeting the needs of an increasing number of large-customer accounts. "
Doc883,Citrix ,2000, Evolving our role in Web-based computing using the enterprise application portal as the foundation for delivering additional customer value in the e-business market. 
Doc884,Citrix ,2000," Earlier this year, we launched our Citrix MetaFrame XP?? family of products the most sophisticated and important product family in Citrix history. Citrix MetaFrame XP is an extended platform release of the award-winning flagship product we first introduced in 1998. This newest edition of the Citrix MetaFrame family makes it simpler for customers to buy and implement Citrix solutions, enabling them to improve their business results with an increased number of more powerful application serving solutions. As we move through 2001, we believe the new Citrix MetaFrame XP family will be the backbone of our product family as we: "
Doc885,Citrix ,2000, Support the ramped up implementation of Windows 2000. Broaden and deepen the value Citrix and our channel provide customers. Increase our ability to enhance application delivery and access over the Web. 
Doc886,Citrix ,2000," Launching an exciting and important product like Citrix MetaFrame XP at the outset of 2001 was the perfect way to begin an exciting and important year for Citrix. The Citrix MetaFrame XP product family is a foundation for the total solution platform we deliver our customers, enabling IT professionals to cost-effectively make the digital workplace available for users any time, everywhere. "
Doc887,Citrix ,2000," We continue to believe that our goal of extending the virtual workplace, everywhere, is the right approach for growth and continued improvement beyond 2000. Throughout the ups and downs, peaks and valleys of our journey, we are sincerely grateful for our dedicated and supportive shareholders. We look forward to more success on this journey, and we hope you will continue to remain part of the Citrix family. "
Doc888,Citrix ,2001,I??ve never been more proud of Citrix than I am today. IT spending may have been down worldwide during 2001. The economy may have struggled. But there??s only one way to describe our performance for the year: ??Rock Solid.?? 
Doc889,Citrix ,2001," Citrix made great strides in 2001 toward accomplishing our vision of making the virtual workplace real. Companies looking for a better way to conduct business are increasingly turning to Citrix solutions. Our strong results for 2001 show it. In the year just completed, we experienced revenue growth of more than 25 percent despite a worldwide economic downturn. These gains are the result of hard work which penetrated more accounts and signed larger deals, expanded services such as our eLicensing program, and product innovation such as the phenomenally successful launch of Citrix MetaFrame XP. We invested in our future with the acquisition of Sequoia Software, the introduction of a new account management program and the expansion of our partner program. "
Doc890,Citrix ,2001," In 2001, we grew both our core business and expanded our product line. We began our effort to establish ourselves as a leader in the access portal market. In 2001 we broadened beyond technology solutions to offer business solutions to customers as part of our strategy to more deeply penetrate the customer base and add more value to their businesses. In all our efforts, we built upon what we do best giving customers the ability to access any application and information from any device over any network. "
Doc891,Citrix ,2001," The journey that Citrix began in 2001 positions us right where we need to be in 2002 and beyond. We are well situated to give our customers flexible, manageable Windows and Web-based solutions to real-world challenges. And we are in the right spot to achieve our business goals for 2002 of further enabling the virtual workplace market and owning the leadership position in the access portal category. "
Doc892,Citrix ,2001," For 2002, we look forward to several new initiatives including providing more solutions to installed-base customers, establishing our new Citrix NFuse Elite access portal product in the marketplace and focusing on specific market opportunities that will help us to grow our business. "
Doc893,Citrix ,2001," I want to thank all the people who helped us achieve the strong financial footing and industry-leading position we enjoy today; everyone from the investment community to our customers, business partners and employees. I invite all of you to stay with us as we move ahead. The vision is clear. The opportunities are waiting. At Citrix, we can??t wait to take advantage of them as we continue to make the virtual workplace real. "
Doc894,Citrix ,2002,Every company has a story. 
Doc895,Citrix ,2002," More than just a sequence of events, it is a set of choices and responses, of actions and reactions, that reveals who a company is, what it stands for, and how it is likely to fare in the future. "
Doc896,Citrix ,2002," The story of Citrix Systems began in 1989, when the company was founded with the vision of simplifying information access. We could call this start-up period our ??Surviving?? phase. Slowly, with determination and six years of hard work, Citrix grew to 80 employees and $14.6 million in revenues. "
Doc897,Citrix ,2002," Phase 2 of the Citrix story began with our IPO in December 1995   the ??Thriving?? phase. One of Fortune??s ??100 Fastest-Growing Companies,?? our revenue increased by more than an order of magnitude in the next six years, reaching $591.6 million in 2001. That put us in the top 10% by revenue of all independent software vendors. We were a market leader in server-based computing, with market share of 76.8%, according to market research firm IDC. Around the world, approximately 35 million people were relying on Citrix for anytime, anywhere, any-device, any-connection access to the on-demand enterprise. "
Doc898,Citrix ,2002, Then came 2002   an extremely difficult year for IT spending. 
Doc899,Citrix ,2002," Last year was our most challenging year since we went public in 1995. The first two quarters were especially tough. Clearly, we had entered a new phase in our company story. It was time to regroup. "
Doc900,Citrix ,2002," We assessed our business: A grand-slam product   Citrix?? MetaFrame XPTM, the most widely deployed presentation server in the world. A channel network with thousands of global resellers, distributors, system integrators and other partners in more than 100 countries, which had proven extremely effective in driving broad adoption of Citrix technology. In fact, nearly 50 million people in more than 120,000 organizations globally use Citrix today. And these customers, based on our ??world-class?? loyalty rating of 94%, are very loyal indeed. "
Doc901,Citrix ,2002," With a limited product line and a single go-to-market strategy, we had achieved an extremely high customer presence, but had a long way to go in terms of our penetration of these organizations. Herein lies the opportunity. "
Doc902,Citrix ,2002," We??ve seen the ??Surviving?? and the ??Thriving?? phases   now we??re in the ??Driving?? phase. At mid-year, we took decisive actions to drive MetaFrame standardization in our customer base. "
Doc903,Citrix ,2002," Our new product strategy is to consolidate access infrastructure, historically fragmented into ??piece parts?? provided by multiple vendors, into one comprehensive solution. The Citrix?? MetaFrame?? Access Suite is an integrated access infrastructure solution that extends the core MetaFrame capabilities across an expanding array of enterprise access requirements, including presentation and application conferencing, device and network services, aggregation and personalization, and security and identity management. "
Doc904,Citrix ,2002, It was just as important for us to diversify our go-to-market approaches as it was our product set. We added a second sales model to our channel: a new ??high customer-touch?? Enterprise Relationship Manager (ERM) program designed to drive deeper relationships with our key customers. 
Doc905,Citrix ,2002," We launched these changes in mid-2002, and in the third quarter returned to revenue growth quarter-over-quarter. In the fourth quarter we saw an even stronger gain in revenues, achieving one of our best quarters ever. But this is the really important part: Six of our top ten fourth-quarter deals were re-orders, and eight of these top ten deals were greater than $500,000, including three over $1 million. Looking at the entire year, the number of deals greater than $500,000 in 2002 increased by 26% over 2001. We believe that our customer relationships are starting to drive MetaFrame standardization. "
Doc906,Citrix ,2002," Our market opportunity is large, and growing. An increasingly mobile, global workforce needs access to the on-demand enterprise to make informed business decisions faster, be more productive, and provide better customer service from anywhere in the world. And companies need simpler and more costeffective ways to consolidate and manage enterprise IT resources. The intersection of these two intensifying market needs is our sweet spot. "
Doc907,Citrix ,2002," We think we have a great story   for our shareholders, our employees, our business partners, and most of all for our customers. Though it??s still early, this story has already revealed much about who we are, what we stand for, and where we??re going. We are the global leader in enterprise access infrastructure. We stand for enabling anytime, anywhere, any-device, any-connection access to the on-demand enterprise. And as for where we??re going   our goal is to surpass $1 billion, and we believe that will be only the beginning. "
Doc908,Citrix ,2003,"accessing information is central to all we do - as individuals, as organizations, as businesses. a doctor who can access accurate patient information from anywhere at anytime can provide better health care. a company that rapidly plugs new branch offices into its information lifeline can more quickly transform them from cost centers into revenue engines. the more you look at the basic activities of life, and the businesses and industries that are built around them, the more clear it becomes. people depend on access for everything they do. "
Doc909,Citrix ,2003," and citrix, the only enterprise software company that is 100% focused on access, is well positioned to meet this universal need. "
Doc910,Citrix ,2003," in our 2002 annual report, i discussed our goal of achieving and sustaining a billion dollars in annual revenue by focusing on access and driving the standardization of citrix access infrastructure as a strategic advantage in business. "
Doc911,Citrix ,2003," we made excellent progress in 2003 - a great year for citrix, strategically, financially, and operationally. "
Doc912,Citrix ,2003," revenues were 589 million, up 12% over our 2002 performance of 527 million. in fact, excluding royalties, 2003 was a record year for citrix revenue. it was also a record year for bookings, driven by solid software license sales and renewals of subscription advantage, our software license update program. annual net income for 2003 was 126.9 million or 0.74 per diluted share, as compared to net income for 2002 of 93.9 million or 0.52 per diluted share. and operating margins were solid at 26%, up from 20% in 2002. "
Doc913,Citrix ,2003," our 2003 performance is the result of long-term strategic planning and reflects the larger market of acccess infrastructure that our new suite of products addresses. it was also a year of exceptional execution - especially in our product, partner, and go-to-market development. 2003 was, in fact, a transformational year in positioning citrix to achieve our goals for growth. "
Doc914,Citrix ,2003," in february, we began repositioning citrix from the server-based computing market into the much larger access infrastructure market - which we estimate will grow to 8-10 billion over the next three to four years. "
Doc915,Citrix ,2003," in march, we announced the citrix metaframe access suite, the most comprehensive access infrastructure solution for accessing any enterprise information resource. by september, we'd shipped upgrades to citrix metaframe presentation server for windows and unix, and three new products, secure access manager, conferencing manager, and password manager. the citrix metaframe access suite had gone from strategy to reality. "
Doc916,Citrix ,2003," at our october customer conference, citrix iforum 2003, we made it easy to buy the suite, with three bundled pricing options - the suite edition for new customers, the step-up edition for existing customers, and the migration edition for metaframe 1.8 customers. "
Doc917,Citrix ,2003," late in q3, we launched our first-ever, multi-million dollar worldwide advertising campaign featuring customers describing how citrix software is helping them grow and improve their business. the multi-faceted campaign, which will continue through 2004, features the cios of such companies as delta air lines, autonation and sumitomo corporation going on record to explain the value of their investment in citrix and the benefits it is yielding for their business. "
Doc918,Citrix ,2003," going forward, we are elevating everything - our focus on access, our market, our products, our customer relationships, our brand, our partners, our employees and our business systems. and to drive the standardization of citrix access infrastructure, we are also elevating access from a tactical component of it to a strategic element of every business. "
Doc919,Citrix ,2003," every business initiative - from m&a to business continuity from partner commerce to branch office expansion, from centralizing it to regulatory compliance - has an information access component that is critical to its succcess. it is the job of cios to support these initiatives by ensuring that employees, customers, and partners have on-demand access to the information they need. "
Doc920,Citrix ,2003," yet, most businesses will employ if-then access tactics when connecting employees demanding information with applications supplying information. if you're at headquarters, for example, then access to an application works one way. if you're at a branch office, the same application is accessed another way. if you're a company's business partner, that application is accessed yet a different way. and so on. these multiplying if-then tactics add greater complexity, more cost and additional rigidity to an already complex and costly it environment. "
Doc921,Citrix ,2003," citrix is a unique position to solve these problems by enabling our customers to create a single, well-conceived holistic strategy for providing secure, easy and instant access - eliminating the if-then approach. our customers are able to provide on-demand access to any application or information, no matter where it lives for anyone from virtually anywhere, anytime, using any device, over any connection. "
Doc922,Citrix ,2003," our focus on access was the rationale for our december agreement to acquire expertcity, a market leader in web-based desktop access services. with the completion of the acquisition at the end of february 2004, expertcity is not the citrix online division, with gotomypc and gotoassist extending citrix access to applications and information that live on the desktop pc. now, whether your applications are hosted on the server, the desktop, or both, you can access them with citrix software. "
Doc923,Citrix ,2003," we entered the year as the leader in server-based computing and exited the year as the leader in a much larger market, with multiple products in an integrated suite, and more products on the way to address the single, critical customer value that citrix stands for: access. "
Doc924,Citrix ,2003," when i look ahead to the rest of 2004 and beyond, i get very excited at our prospects. i believe that we've laid the groundwork for growth in a large-scale, long-term infrastructure market. "
Doc925,Compuware ,1995,This was a remarkable year for Compuware Corporation. lt was both disappointing and extremely exciting. 
Doc926,Compuware ,1995, Disappointing in the sense that we did not meet financial analysts?? expectations and our stock price has suffered as a consequence. This is even more frustrating in light of the Company's exciting performance across both the sohware products and professional services segments of the Company. All aspects of our business were outstanding in comparison to the industry. We were able to introduce several new products and our business grew significantly. 
Doc927,Compuware ,1995," Revenue grew 35.4% year over year. This represents $139.5 million in new revenue. Net income, before special charges, grew 56.2%, and eamings per share, again before special charges, grew 32.8% "
Doc928,Compuware ,1995," Since 1990, Compuware's mainframe product revenue has grown at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 30%, which confirms the ongoing importance of that business. Our client/server product revenue was approximately $95 million with year over year growth in excess of 70%. We are convinced that our strategy for client/server computing is sound and that our product offerings are among the finest in the industry. The Company's professional services revenue grew almost 37% and higher value added client/server consulting allowed us to increase margins significantly. All told, an impressive achievement in this very competitive marketplace. "
Doc929,Compuware ,1995," For most other companies, this kind of performance would be considered outstanding and exceptional. As Compuware managers, we share the frustrations of our shareholders but we are looking forward to our new fiscal year. The business is rock solid. Mainframe products, client/server products and professional services are all poised for solid growth. We have a strong, seasoned management team and highly capable employee body, We believe that analysts?? expectations are more reasonable and that we have some excellent opportunities. "
Doc930,Compuware ,1995," l would like to thank the Company's more than 4,000 employees, our customers and everyone who has invested in Compuware as we strive for continuing growth. "
Doc931,Compuware ,1996,During fiscal 1996. Compuware continued to make great strides toward completing a transition that redefines our organization and strengthens our position for growth. Compuware is no longer mainframe-centric. We now move forward as a Company that offers solutions across mainframe and client/server technologies. 
Doc932,Compuware ,1996," The latter phases of this transition include initiatives to prepare Compuware for additional growth as well. To this end, a model for global decentralized operations is now in place. Named Compuware 2000, it has become our model for future organizational design. By partitioning the activities of development laboratories, country sales offices and professional services branch offices, the Company believes it is better positioned to manage growth efficiently. The respective core areas of product development and marketing. strategic and tactical sales and the deployment of professional services on a global scale can be kept in sharperfocus as we progress. "
Doc933,Compuware ,1996," Revenues for the fiscal year ending March 31 1996, were $614 million, up 15.1% from the prior year. Before special charges, net income for the fiscal year was $763 million and earnings per share were $1.70. "

Doc935,Compuware ,1996," A Commitment to Solutions during fiscal 1996, Compuware launched a project that underscores the unique synergy of Compuware's products and services divisions. production 2000, a century date-change solution for clients, combines a definitive project methodology with specific date-change related techniques for deploying Compuware testing, debugging and quality assurance tools. Production 2000 engagements are now underway and more are scheduled. "
Doc936,Compuware ,1996," Our application development environment, UNIFACE, now has over 3,000 customers worldwide, and has grown to be our third largest selling product. Taken in combination, the UNIFACE product, our growing professional services capabilities, our expanding set of testing and debugging tools for client/server, and our successful offerings in client/server application management offer our clients and prospects a solution set that is an industry benchmark. Our foundation for growth has never been stronger. "
Doc937,Compuware ,1996," I wish to thank Compuware shareholders customers and partners. In addition, please join me in recognizing the outstanding contributions of our management team and of each and every Compuware employee. "
Doc938,Compuware ,1997,"Fiscal 1997 was a year of significant accomplishment for Compuware Corporation. Our end-of-year results confirm that the course we are following is a sound one, and I am pleased to report that we are well positioned to continue executing our strategy in the current fiscal year. The Company is now in its 25th year of operation, and has changed to the extent that our client/server offerings are fast becoming the drive behind our present growth. This is truly a milestone that follows noteworthy developments throughout the range of our product and services offerings. "
Doc939,Compuware ,1997," In fiscal 1997, we experienced renewed momentum in UNIFACE sales, an expanded pipeline for Eco5COPE sales, and a warm reception by industry analysts for our new QACenter client/server testing tools. In addition, new license sales of our mainframe products continue to be exceptionally strong. We recognize that mainframe technology continues to have a role in business-critical applications. Today, mainframe computing represents a standard for stability and power, and for client/server deployments, a means of functioning as a very large server. Our Professional Services Division also grew during this pastfiscal year. Services growth was fueled in part by greater demand among our clients for stand-alone client/server professional services and for value-added services related to UNIFACE. "
Doc940,Compuware ,1997, 
Doc941,Compuware ,1997," Revenues for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1997 were $812.9 million, up 32.3% from the prior year. Before special charges, net income for the fiscal year was $113.7 million and earnings per share were $2.53 (pre-split) and $1.26 (post-split). "

Doc943,Compuware ,1997," The course followed in fiscal 1997 enabled the Company to further unfold a strategy that was first detailed almost three years ago. Compuware's mission then was to move from being a predominately mainframe-driven organization to one that could jointly serve the established mainframe and emerging clien/server marketplaces. This meant planning for new products and services, and expanding our business alliance partnerships. Our focus on end-to-end application stability also helped to guide our progress. For that reason, the scope of the Compuware built-test-manage product offerings has become unique in our industry. The value of our mainframe testing and implementation products continues to be underscored by customers who ask us to participate in their comprehensive enterprise-wide initiatives. And today, the migration of testing and implementation products from their mainframe beginnings to client/server platforms is a reality. In turn, our professional services business now reaches across all of our client/server product offerings. "
Doc944,Compuware ,1997," Our strategy also called for the building of an organization that could sustain future growth. Going forward as?? a global decentralized organization, the Company benefits from the Compuware 2000 model of organizational design which was unveiled last year. Cornpuware 2000 will continue to help with the efficient management of growth. "
Doc945,Compuware ,1997," I wish to thank Compuware shareholders, customers, partners and employees for a year that enables us to look ahead with enthusiasm. "
Doc946,Compuware ,1998,"Fiscal 1998 was an outstanding year for Compuware Corporation, distinguished by significant growth in revenue and profitability. Our success in reaching the $1 billion revenue milestone further validates our strategy of providing practical solutions to our clients and ensuring that Compuware is recognized as a leading information technology provider by every Chief Information Officer. As we continue to execute this strategy during the current fiscal year, I remain optimistic about our opportunities for future success. "
Doc947,Compuware ,1998," In fiscal 1998, we achieved excellent growth in our client/server offerings, which we continued to improve through strategic acquisitions and business alliances with key information technology vendors. New license sales of mainframe products remained strong, confirming the size of this market and the effectiveness of our expanding worldwide distribution capability. Our UNIFACE product line achieved positive momentum, solidifying its reputation as the gold standard in component-based development tools. We also implemented an increasing number of ??end-to-end?? solutions for our clients, which seamlessly integrate Compuware consultants, products and professional services to solve difficult business problems. Well-received by our clients and industry analysts, we expect these integrated solutions to expand our presence and enhance our competitiveness. "
Doc948,Compuware ,1998, Fiscal 1998 also marked the launch of a comprehensive brand advertising campaign that positioned Compuware as the leading provider of ??People and Software for Business Applications.?? The considerable name recognition this campaign continues to generate from the tagline ??What Do You Need Most??? is building solid brand awareness and increasing the visibility of Compuware with large clients. 
Doc949,Compuware ,1998," Standing behind our accomplishments this fiscal year was an experienced executive management staff and a team of dedicated employees, who made the success of our company their first priority. "
Doc950,Compuware ,1998," Revenues for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1998 were $1.139 billion, up 40.2% from the prior year. Before special charges, net income for the fiscal year was $198.5 million and earnings per share were $1.13 (basic EPS) and $1.02 (diluted EPS). "

Doc952,Compuware ,1998," SEVEN REASONS FOR GROWTH We believe there are seven fundamental reasons why Compuware can expect to succeed and prosper going forward. I??d like to share those with you: Information technologies are additive. Rather than replacing old technology, new uses are found for new technology. Compuware has built and is successfully managing a worldwide distribution capability for its products and services. Our mainframe technology readily transfers to other platforms. Client/server products scale down, opening up new, broader markets. Within our worldwide customer base, many opportunities for large deals remain. The worldwide market for our professional services is huge and growing. UNIFACE is superbly wellpositioned within its market segment. "
Doc953,Compuware ,1998," I wish to thank Compuware shareholders, clients and partners. In addition, please join me in recognizing the outstanding contributions of our management team and employees. "
Doc954,Compuware ,1999,"Fiscal 1999 was another year of outstanding growth in revenue and profitability for Compuware Corporation. During the year, we reached more than $1.6 billion in revenue and earned wide recognition from many of the world??s largest 20,000 corporations for the value we bring to their businesses. Our strategy of providing practical solutions that deliver immediate and measurable return on our clients?? Information Technology (IT) investments continued to be a successful one, validated by double-digit growth in all business lines. As we continue to execute this strategy during the current fiscal year, I remain confident of our opportunities for continued growth and see no significant impediments to achieving our aggressive goals. "
Doc955,Compuware ,1999," Compuware??s strong fiscal year results reflect the value our clients continue to find in the products and professional services we offer. During fiscal 1999, we enhanced this value by introducing new versions of our products, extending product support and integration, acquiring new technology, entering into key productivity partnerships and expanding our professional services staff. These activities enabled us to achieve excellent growth in our mainframe and client/server product lines and to further integrate Compuware people, products and professional services into valuable solutions for our clients. "
Doc956,Compuware ,1999," Supporting e-commerce and web-based systems was a critical part of our strategy during fiscal 1999. Today, e-commerce, or web-based systems development and deployment, represents more that 12 percent of our license and services revenue. We expect this new technology to continue to add to our strength, contribute to our revenue and provide us with yet another engine for growth. "
Doc957,Compuware ,1999," Another important development this fiscal year was the tremendous number of companies that re-legitimized their mainframe environments by spending millions of dollars to make them Year 2000 (Y2K) compliant, thereby committing themselves to that resource for the foreseeable future. Our experience shows us that if a company wants efficient, secure, rapid-response, high-transaction Internet applications, they have almost exclusively picked a mainframe as their server. Given Compuware??s role as the preeminent supplier of mainframe productivity tools, we fully expect these companies to look to Compuware for their productivity solutions. "
Doc958,Compuware ,1999," Revenues for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1999 were $1.638 billion, up 43.8 percent from the prior year. Before special charges, net income for the fiscal year was $352.7 million and earnings per share were 96 cents (basic EPS) and 88 cents (diluted EPS). "
Doc959,Compuware ,1999," Software license fee revenue increased 46.2 percent during fiscal 1999, growing from $467.3 million to $683.4 million. Maintenance revenue grew 36.9 percent from $244.3 million to $334.4 million and professional services fees increased 45.1 percent from $427.8 million to $620.7 million. "
Doc960,Compuware ,1999," Why Compuware Will Continue to Create Value Here are a few reasons why Compuware will continue to create value for our clients: Compuware products offer our clients tremendous value in short time frames. Our products have long, useful lives. They are constantly updated to reflect new and changing technology. Compuware products improve the productivity of our clients?? employees, not their infrastructure. Consequently, we are not susceptible to the cyclical nature of MIP shipments. Our products provide the same compelling productivity and value proposition when used in new development, maintenance or package installs. They are particularly useful for e-commerce and web-based applications. "
Doc961,Compuware ,1999," Having just completed a year in which we smashed every expectation by a wide margin, we now have an exciting opportunity to duplicate this difficult feat during the current fiscal year. "
Doc962,Compuware ,1999," I firmly believe that our strategies, practices and people will continue to create value for clients and show you why Compuware is one of the best high-tech companies in the world. "
Doc963,Compuware ,2000,This was a remarkable year for Compuware Corporation. It was both extremely exciting and very challenging. 
Doc964,Compuware ,2000," This past year the company grew more than 36 percent, reaching over $2.2 billion in revenues. Through acquisitions and internal growth we added almost 5,000 information technology (IT) professionals to our staff, increasing our ranks to nearly 16,000 full-time employees. Our profit margins continued to be among the highest in the industry, although our stock price slumped due to the fact that we missed our analysts?? expectations. "
Doc965,Compuware ,2000," Many IT companies experienced difficulty on Wall Street in the past year, particularly those firms whose profits were exceeded by their marketing hype. During this time period, we concentrated on growing and maintaining a solid, healthy business that will continue to perform consistently over time. Our perspective was, is and will be a long-term perspective. We are continuing to work very hard to make sure our investors receive the returns they have come to expect from Compuware. "
Doc966,Compuware ,2000," Fiscal year 2000 was very similar to fiscal year 1995, a year in which we experienced excellent growth and profitability, yet suffered from a declining stock price. I compare the two years for one simple reason: we have the opportunity once again to grow the value of Compuware significantly. "
Doc967,Compuware ,2000, Compuware has continued to grow and prosper for more than 27 years because we are a strong and resilient business that delivers real value to its customers. Our products and professional services are not tied to the latest technology and are therefore not vulnerable to constantly shifting technological trends. Delivering value to customers never goes out of style. 
Doc968,Compuware ,2000," We focus on what works and on what our customers tell us they need most. And that??s why our clients keep coming back. They know we can help them use technology to solve business problems, and that we can help them improve the efficiency and productivity of their businesses. In good times or bad, Compuware solutions are always in demand. "
Doc969,Compuware ,2000," Important developments that occurred during fiscal year 2000: Large Contracts During fiscal year 2000, Compuware and its health care affiliate, CareTech Solutions, Inc., announced a 10-year, $1 billion agreement with The Detroit Medical Center (DMC) for the outsourcing of DMC??s Information Systems Division.

Doc970,Compuware ,2000," Professional Resources Compuware acquired Data Processing Resources Corporation (DPRC) during fiscal year 2000 through a cash tender offer. DPRC was a leading national professional services company that focused on the IT sector and provided professional services to a diverse group of Fortune 1000 clients worldwide. Approximately 3,400 DPRC technical professionals joined Compuware??s Professional Services Division as a result of the acquisition. The addition of these technicians enabled us to deliver professional services solutions to 27 new cities in the western, southwestern and southeastern United States. "
Doc971,Compuware ,2000," E-Commerce Supporting Internet, e-commerce and web-based systems continued to be an important part of our strategy during fiscal year 2000. Demand was strong for our suite of products and professional services for the complete e-commerce life cycle, from initial strategy through the ongoing development, testing, marketing and managing of web sites. "
Doc972,Compuware ,2000," Compuware established its first two Digital Development Centers during fiscal year 2000. Located in Kansas City, Missouri and Farmington Hills, Michigan, these centers provide our customers with a complete range of e-commerce services from web site strategy, conceptualization, creation and performance management to back-office architecture, legacy integration and load testing. "
Doc973,Compuware ,2000," For all the excitement and challenge e-commerce can generate, the reality is that the technology is still based on a software application. Compuware has specialized in providing services and tools that focus on software applications  and how to optimize their business value since our inception. As long as our customers continue to derive value from this newest wave of technology, Compuware will be there to support them. "
Doc974,Compuware ,2000," Business Alliances Compuware??s Corporate Alliances Division provides technology, education, technical support and cooperative marketing efforts to ensure that Compuware solutions support each environment. Tier-one partners with whom we established or strengthened alliances during the fiscal year include IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Siebel Systems, SAP, PeopleSoft and Compaq.

Also included are frequently asked questions, executive biographies, mergers and acquisitions and information request forms. In addition, investors can use our web site to sign up for e-mail alerts that will notify them when new content is added to the site, as well as register to hear live webcasts of company quarterly earnings conference calls. "
Doc976,Compuware ,2000," Compuware??s new investor relations toll-free phone line (1-877-779-CPWR) allows investors to listen to the latest financial release, summaries of the latest company news releases and the most frequently asked questions. Investors can also request investor kits, press releases by fax and to talk directly with an investor relations representative. "
Doc977,Compuware ,2000," New Headquarters To support our growing workforce, Compuware and the City of Detroit announced an agreement to move Compuware??s corporate headquarters to downtown Detroit.

Doc983,Compuware ,2000," Since 1973, Compuware solutions have delivered productivity, quality, performance and adaptability. Regardless of the technology our clients choose to employ, they continue to choose Compuware to deliver the most precious commodity of all: value. "
Doc984,Compuware ,2000, Thank you for your support of Compuware. We are working very hard to make sure you are rewarded for your confidence in our company. 
Doc985,Compuware ,2001,What a year it has been. Stock valuations across industries and markets are uniformly down. Macroeconomic conditions have had a significant impact on the technology business. Many unprofitable dot-coms and their shaky business models have dried up and blown away. 
Doc986,Compuware ,2001," Yet some companies, Compuware among them, remain profitable in this environment, because we offer compelling economic and technological value to our customers. At Compuware, this is a tribute to the loyal, talented and committed employees who dedicate themselves to our company, believe in our strategy and help make it a reality. "
Doc987,Compuware ,2001," I would also like to thank our shareholders for their continued support of this company. Since our Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 1992, Compuware's market capitalization has increased approximately 400 percent. If you have held Compuware shares since our IPO, you have earned a return of more than 227 percent, based on April 24, 2001 data. You have also witnessed numerous other periods of spectacular growth, including a three-year period when our stock delivered an 872.8 percent total return. "
Doc988,Compuware ,2001," I recognize this year has been an awful one for our shareholders and our business, but I believe Compuware has emerged stronger for it. Our company is more focused, more competitive and more responsive than we were when I last wrote you. We are aggressively monitoring our administrative costs and processes to ensure that our product developers and professional services staff are able to do what they do best: help our clients get more value from their computer systems. We will continue to use our administration and management teams to support our technical staff, allowing them the freedom to be innovative and successful. "
Doc989,Compuware ,2001," Despite changing technologies and newly emerging challenges, the roots of our business philosophy remain simple: We help people do things with computers. Compuware upholds these principles because they work, proven by the success we've experienced through nearly 29 years in the technology business. The Compuware philosophy doesn't prevent us from pursuing opportunities that involve new technologies. Rather, our processes, our people and our software continue to help our customers wring the most value out of all of their technology. This means that Compuware is not dependent on the technology of the moment, because we deliver value that transcends technological trends. Compuware's roots are described in our mission statement and business objectives, and I refer to them often, because I know they are the reason for our past achievements and the basis of our future success. "
Doc990,Compuware ,2001," Compuware's mission is to be the best worldwide provider of quality software products and professional services that increase productivity. We strive to meet the needs of our customers and exceed what they expect of us. Our continued success in accomplishing this mission enables us to reward our employees and shareholders. Our mission isn't complicated, but it's valuable. In times when everyone is watching the bottom line, few things are more valued than a trusted partner like Compuware, with our ability to help businesses save time and money. "
Doc991,Compuware ,2001," We use our business objectives as a map to accomplish our mission. These objectives are based on healthy growth and controlled costs. Our objectives are also centered on meeting the needs of our customers and surpassing their expectations for service. In the coming year, we will continue to work hard to meet all of our business objectives so we can fulfill our mission and, ultimately, increase the size and value of our company. The entire executive leadership team at Compuware is committed to achieving our mission and moving the company forward in a steady, sustainable manner that will help Compuware grow while giving you our investors, a solid return. "
Doc992,Compuware ,2001," The remainder of our 2001 Annual Report is focused on three topics: how we got to where we are today, how we plan to grow Compuware and why we expect to be successful. Before we examine these topics, let's review our plans and goals from last year. In our fiscal 2000 Annual Report, we described five objectives in our Looking Ahead section. Here are last year's goals and how we achieved them: "
Doc993,Compuware ,2001," To transition our Professional Services Division (PSD) to a business model that emphasizes sales as well as delivery. We have spent the past year retooling our services division, Margins have improved significantly, from negative 8.4 percent at the close of the fiscal 2000 fourth quarter to positive 4.7 percent at the end of the fiscal 2001 fourth quarter. Our services organization, which is more focused and more competitive than it was a year ago, is now under the guidance of Senior Vice President Alan Cantrell. "
Doc994,Compuware ,2001," We have implemented organizational changes in the services business, allowing our sales force to work more directly with our clients. These organizational changes have not only improved our client relationships, they have given our customers more opportunities to directly communicate their business needs to our services team. Unfortunately, services results throughout the year were hampered by our continuing integration of DPRC into Compuware and, to a lesser extent, the economic climate. We are addressing these problems and we expect to increase profits and head count in the coming year. "
Doc995,Compuware ,2001," Integrate product and professional services offerings more closely. Our PointForward solution is an example of our successful efforts in this area. Recently cited by industry analysts as a visionary offering, PointForward combines the technical strength of our software with the experience of our services staff. PointForward is delivered to our clients over the Internet, giving them a rapid and flexible solution for monitoring the performance of web-based applications. We plan to make further strides integrating our products and services, and we will continue to use our integrated solutions to differentiate ourselves from our competition. "
Doc996,Compuware ,2001," Maintain our competitive edge in the mainframe market. We continue to develop and improve upon our industry-leading mainframe products. These products have helped thousands of organizations across the world save time and money. Our mainframe products provide powerful analysis and testing functionality across multiple platforms and help mainframe programmers test more accurately and reliably and recover from errors more quickly. The strength of our mainframe product line is its compelling value proposition, and I believe this segment of our business will continue to demonstrate solid growth. "
Doc997,Compuware ,2001," Leverage our competitive strengths in the distributed systems market. Compuware has more than 25,000 customers who use our software or services. These clients know and trust Compuware, giving us a competitive advantage in sales of new distributed products. We will continue to put that advantage to full use. Compuware will also continue to capitalize on our position as one of the most profitable, financially stable companies in the distributed software market. Our profitability and financial stability allow us to invest significant resources in improving and integrating our distributed product family. We have continually enhanced our distributed products over the past year, and these efforts are beginning to pay off. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, our new license revenue from distributed products showed a 27.2 percent rate of sequential growth. If this growth rate continues, we wouid see Compuware's distributed products revenue increase more than 150 percent over the next fiscal year. "
Doc998,Compuware ,2001," Align the organization to better support customers and facilitate teamwork. A number of organizational changes took place in fiscal 2001 that will help us continue to meet this goal. Our executive team has been restructured, and I'm confident that we have chosen the right people for the challenges facing Compuware. We have also changed the structure of our products organization, from an organization based on individual product lines to an organization based on product functions. This new structure helps speed the integration of products with related functions and also helps get software to market more quickly. As I previously mentioned, we have also made significant changes to the structure of our services organization, allowing us to more efficiently and effectively serve our clients. "
Doc999,Compuware ,2001," Our successful work toward these goals has provided Compuware with a solid foundation from which to grow in fiscal 2002. During the upcoming fiscal year, we expect to increase our earnings per share in the 40-to-50 percent range, fueled by an increasingly profitable professional services business and improved software sales. "
Doc1000,Compuware ,2001," I am energized and optimistic about fiscal year 2002. We are poised to achieve our goals, because our organization rests on a base of strong fundamentals and talented individuals. We are committed to delivering long-term value to our shareholders, our customers and our employees. We believe our strategy for the upcoming year will help us honor these commitments. Thank you for your investment in our company. "
Doc1001,Compuware ,2002,"Fiscal 2002 was a difficult year for Compuware Corporation. While our stock price increased 32.4 percent for the fiscal year, we suffered a 14 percent reduction in revenues. Additionally, for the first time in our history, we made the painful decision to significantly reduce Compuware??s workforce. These reductions were implemented in areas where our staff was underutilized and our market share could not support business growth. In order to be a successful company, Compuware must grow, and grow profitably. This restructuring, though difficult, will improve Compuware??s profitability and better position the company for long-term growth benefiting our employees and shareholders. "
Doc1002,Compuware ,2002," The positive news is that Compuware remains profitable, and our fundamental financial position is very sound. We have outstanding cash flow, no long-term debt and more than $400 million in cash and cash equivalents. The restructuring announced at the beginning of fiscal 2003 should reduce our annual expenses by approximately $200 million and considerably improve our professional services margins. "
Doc1003,Compuware ,2002," These strong fundamentals mean that Compuware has a good base from which to build. Outstanding employees, excellent technology and the strength of our financial position will help ensure our growth and profitability. But growth and profitability aren??t enough. No one on our executive management team is content with Compuware being merely a good company. We want more than that and our employees and investors deserve it. But we must increase our revenues and earnings to achieve a better stock price. This is one of my chief responsibilities, and I take it very seriously. "
Doc1004,Compuware ,2002," However, increasing revenue growth for a billion-dollar-plus company is a much greater challenge than increasing growth for a smaller organization. This law of large numbers is compounded by the hangover currently affecting our industry. For too many years, companies have poured millions of dollars into packaged applications, dot-coms and overpriced consultants, only to find they needed to spend many times that amount to implement the technology. Decision-makers at these companies are not receiving the return they expect on investments of this magnitude, making them leery of technology investments altogether. Compuware has an advantage here. Our products and services demonstrate some of the most compelling return on investment of any in the industry. Nonetheless, this is the mindset we must overcome in an already difficult economic environment. "
Doc1005,Compuware ,2002," The issues we must address are not only external. In the late 1990s, it was much easier to make money as a technology company than it is today. The business walking in through the door took priority over addressing organizational inefficiencies. Today??s economic reality, however, means we must transform our business to succeed: not through a magic pill, or a marketing campaign, but through fundamental change and hard work. Companies the size of Compuware cannot change instantly. But we are committed to changing because we must to meet our goals. "
Doc1006,Compuware ,2002," Last year??s goals were: to maintain our competitive edge in the mainframe market, to expand our distributed systems market share and to grow our professional services business. How did we do  While the overall business is still profitable and healthy, our results in attaining these goals were largely unimpressive. "
Doc1007,Compuware ,2002," Our mainframe business continues to be strong. For the year, our mainframe products?? revenue was $687.3 million. Nearly 30 years in the mainframe products business give Compuware a profitable maintenance base, high margins and longstanding business relationships with Fortune 1,000 companies. Our mainframe business is a competitive advantage that none of our competitors in the distributed marketplace has, giving us significant cash flow for research and development. Since our mainframe business remains the bedrock upon which we will expand our already formidable family of distributed products, we are aggressively defending our mainframe revenue through continual development efforts. "
Doc1008,Compuware ,2002," As a percentage of software revenues, we did not significantly increase distributed systems products?? revenue during the fiscal year. Though these results were disappointing, our capacity for growth in this market is enormous, and increasing distributed systems revenue remains a key focus for the company. Compuware distributed products, like our mainframe tools, reduce our customers?? expenses, save their time and make their staff more productive. Compuware invests a significant percentage of our research and development (R&D) dollars in our distributed products an investment dwarfing the percentage of revenue and absolute dollars spent by our competitors in the distributed marketplace. Our R&D efforts are strengthening our awardwinning distributed product family, and over the next year we will work toward making every one of our distributed products a ??must have.?? "
Doc1009,Compuware ,2002," We were unable to significantly improve our margins or build the critical mass required for growth in our services business this fiscal year. These facts led us to restructure our professional services business beginning in April 2002. While this was a difficult decision, we believe the restructuring will allow Compuware to begin growing its professional services business profitably again. We intend to manage our off-assignment personnel and our hiring practices more effectively, preventing a recurrence of the problems that limited services revenue growth this year. Compuware remains committed to the services business. Our services personnel create new sales opportunities by representing our company to customers around the world, and they continue to provide us with timely, accurate intelligence on customer needs. "
Doc1010,Compuware ,2002," As we reviewed our goals from last year, and our plans for the next fiscal year, it became apparent that a fundamental change in the structure and operations of our entire company was necessary. We??re profitable and stable, but Compuware is not growing the way it must to be a successful company and a successful investment. To that end, we have implemented a new organizational structure, based on four cornerstones: One Company, Process Driven, Customer Facing and Employees = Assets. These cornerstones represent an essential change in the way Compuware conducts business every day. I believe in these cornerstones, and I believe in the people who are implementing them. Continue reading this report to learn more about our strategy for change and our plans for products and services in the coming year. These changes are essential and ongoing, and they are the keys to our success. "
Doc1011,Compuware ,2002, Thank you for investing in Compuware Corporation. I??m working very hard to make sure your faith in our company is rewarded. I look forward to reporting to you on our progress again next year. 
Doc1012,Compuware ,2003,"Compuware remained profitable and debt-free during fiscal 2003, enhancing our ability to produce competitive offerings that deliver the productivity and value customers demand. In our 30th year of continuous operation, we have excellent cash flow, more than $500 million in cash and investments, and exciting new initiatives we believe will help us grow the company. "
Doc1013,Compuware ,2003," We achieved our financial status in spite of a sluggish economy, excess capacity and increased price pressure from competitors and customers. For the third consecutive year, spending on Information Technology (IT) was flat, making sales cycles longer and deals more difficult to complete. "
Doc1014,Compuware ,2003," While it is difficult to predict when market conditions will improve, we are confident the market is going to change before long, and we are well positioned to take advantage of any upturns. We are equally confident in the four strategic initiatives we??re launching in fiscal 2004. These initiatives complement and extend our existing products and services, helping customers quickly and reliably put business applications into action. Compuware??s four strategic initiatives for this fiscal year are the Compuware Application Reliability Solution (CARS), OptimalJ, Vantage and our NearShore Development Center. "
Doc1015,Compuware ,2003," CARS Software quality, reliability and time-to-market are some of the biggest challenges facing IT organizations today. CARS helps IT organizations meet these challenges through the use of highly skilled people, a solid testing methodology and industry-leading products. By linking development, quality assurance and operations, CARS is the only solution on the market that offers customers the people, processes and products necessary to ensure the quality and reliability of their most important business applications. "
Doc1016,Compuware ,2003," OptimalJ Developing enterprise applications using Java technologies is complex and difficult, slowing down advanced Java developers and causing difficulty for mainstream developers. OptimalJ is an advanced development environment that enables developers of all experience levels to rapidly design, develop and deploy reliable, industrial-strength enterprise applications. Increasing productivity by as much as 40 percent, OptimalJ generates complete, maintainable working applications directly from a visual model, using sophisticated patterns to implement accepted best practices for J2EE coding. "
Doc1017,Compuware ,2003," Vantage The primary measure of a Chief Information Officer??s success is the delivery of reliable, high-performing software applications that support the core business needs of the organization. The focus of Compuware??s Vantage suite is to provide unsurpassed visibility and control over software application deployment, monitoring and problem resolution in complex data processing environments. "
Doc1018,Compuware ,2003," NearShore Development Center More than ever before, companies today are initiating cost-saving efforts by outsourcing application development and maintenance to external service providers. Alongside our traditional services business which offers the services of skilled IT professionals at a reasonable cost we also offer customers our NearShore Development Center (NSDC) in Montreal. Compuware??s NSDC is a lowcost vehicle that delivers value to our North American customers who desire comprehensive outsourcing services for the support of their distributed, e-business or enterprise software. "
Doc1019,Compuware ,2003," We are currently engaged in substantial launch, marketing and public relations efforts that are focused specifically on these four key initiatives. Our ability to conduct these activities is supported by our almost 30-year affiliation with mainframe software the bedrock upon which our business was built. It has afforded us a substantial maintenance base, high profit margins, quality business prospects and longstanding relationships with practically all Fortune 1000 companies. Compuware mainframe software sales also give us a steady source for financing the research and development necessary to be successful in the distributed software sector. "
Doc1020,Compuware ,2003," Maintenance renewal rates for our mainframe products continued to be very high during fiscal 2003, solid evidence that our software continues to deliver value to customers every day. To further demonstrate the payback our mainframe applications provide over the competition, we??ve developed Return-On-Investment calculators for our mainframe products. These tools are already being used successfully by our sales force to demonstrate to customers the large cost savings our mainframe software products deliver. "
Doc1021,Compuware ,2003," I can assure you that our management team and employees are giving you their very best efforts toward meeting Compuware??s goals for the new fiscal year. As our shareholders, you deserve no less. "
Doc1022,ea ,1995,"During fiscal 1995 we continued to grow our business and build greater market share around the world, not only in the 16-bit cartridge market. but in the emerging global market for CD-ROM products. We added depth to our award-winning product development organization and continued to extend our direct distribution capabilities. We believe Electronic Arts (EA) is now strongly positioned for creative and financial leadership in the coming 32-bit era of interactive entertainment. "
Doc1023,ea ,1995," Fiscal 1995 marked EA??s tenth straight year of profitability. Net income increased 25 percent to $55.7 million, as revenues rose18 percent to $493.3 million. Earnings per share grew to $1.07 from $0.86 in fiscal 1994, and return on equity remained strong at 27 percent. CD-ROM titles contributed more than $100 million in revenue, or 21 percent of the total, compared to less than $14 million in fiscal 1994. International revenues increased by more than 49 percent to $158 million. accounting for 32 percent of EA??s fiscal 1995 revenues. "
Doc1024,ea ,1995," As we expected, the 16-bit cartridge market peaked in calendar 1994 as growth in this category slowed to just 10 percent. This clearly signals that the current generation of hardware systems is about to be eclipsed by the next wave of gaming and multimedia technology. Anticipating this transition, we reduced our overall number of cartridge products, concentrated releases during the year-end holiday season, and focused our marketing efforts on creating hit products. All these efforts were rewarded. In the U.S., we took four of the top 10 spots in the Sega?? Genesis market during the holiday season. ln England, FIFA international Soccer was the number one best-selling cartridge product, and in Australia we outsold all other 16-bit competitors for the first time. For the season and the year, we significantly increased our share of the global 16-bit market. "
Doc1025,ea ,1995," Electronic Arts?? strategy has been to quickly establish a critical mass of high-quality products for important new hardware platforms. While optimizing revenues and profits in the mature 16-bit market, we are aggressively developing exciting new products for 32-bit platforms. EA has emerged from previous platform transitions stronger with a market position, a more valuable intellectual property portfolio a broader technology base, and more extensive distribution capabilities. We are working to ensure that the current transition from 16-bit to 32-bit technology is no exception. "
Doc1026,ea ,1995," We believe that we have launched more entertainment titles than any other publisher for CD-ROM platforms including the SDO Interactive Multiplayer?? (SDO), lBM????compatible PCs, and the Apple Macintosh Among our best-selling original titles on CD-ROM during the year were Magic Carpet?? Road & Track Presents??: The Need For Speed, Shock Wave?? Wing Commander , and U.S. Navy Fighters?? We also scored hits with existing franchise properties by extending and enhancing them in 32-bit form. in this category, Theme Park?? NBA?? Live '95, PGA TOUR Golf 486, and Road Rash?? were all popular best-sellers. "
Doc1027,ea ,1995," Our early development investments in 3DO, the first 32-bit CD-ROM game system, proved successful as EA products dominated the 3DO best-seller lists during the holiday season. We are already selling products for Sega?? Saturn?? and the Sony?? PlayStation'??in Japan, and will dramatically increase the number of products available for those game systems when they are launched in North America and Europe this calendar year. "
Doc1028,ea ,1995, Today??s technology transition plays to Electronic Arts?? core strength in product development. We have an unmatched portfolio of intellectual property assets that we can bring forward from cartridge game systems and personal computers to dedicated CD-ROM us to maximize our return on product development and to quickly bring familiar brand-name products to advanced technology platforms. 
Doc1029,ea ,1995," At the same time, our product development teams around the world have an early lead in utilizing the audiovisual capabilities of 32-bit technology for interactive entertainment. EA??s creative forces are producing not just new titles. but entirely new product categories. One such new category is interactive movies, which offer sound and picture quality that replicate the experience of broadcast television. interactive movies give viewers multiple ways to interact with the story line, characters, and key events, while influencing the ultimate outcome of the entertainment experience. "
Doc1030,ea ,1995," EA??s first interactive movie, Wing Commander Ill, won widespread critical acclaim and went on to sell more than 400,000 units by the end of the fiscal year. Developed in the U.S., Wing Commander Ill has demonstrated its worldwide appeal by earning 46 percent of its revenues outside North America. We believe the additional products we are developing within this category will also gain a wide following and potentially broaden our customer demographics. "
Doc1031,ea ,1995," During fiscal 1995 we added one of the industry's finest interactive entertainment studios to our worldwide creative team. Bullfrog Productions Ltd., based in Surrey, England, is the top European developer of PC-CD entertainment software. Its string of six consecutive number one European hits includes Magic Carpet, Populous Syndicate, and Theme Park.Bullfrog joins EA??s award-winning studios in California, Texas. Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Our development headcount now stands at approximately 700 people around the globe. "
Doc1032,ea ,1995," To further leverage our talent pool we formed a joint venture with Capital Cities/ABC, called Creative Wonders, lnc., to develop educational, informational, and reference products for children and families. Capital Cities/ABC will contribute programming content from its TV production unit, which produces popular animated series such as School House Rock,?? and from its ABC News and creative talent, expertise in interactive software development. and intellectual property from our EA Kids brand. EA is the exclusive distributor of all new titles produced by Creative Wonders. "
Doc1033,ea ,1995," Direct distribution is one of EA??s core strengths and a significant competitive advantage in the battle for retail shelf space. In the first quarter of fiscal 1996 we opened a new distribution center in Louisville, Kentucky. This will result in faster, more responsive service for our customers based in the eastern half of the country. lt also allows us to provide direct-to-store deliveries which, combined with electronic data interchange (EDI) systems. improves our inventory control and feedback on retail market trends. "
Doc1034,ea ,1995," Our strategy is to build equally strong direct distribution capabilities in our international markets, and we took significant strides in that direction in fiscal 1995. We acquired two major independent distributors of entertainment software, DROSoft in Spain and Kingsoft GmbH in Germany, that have distributed EA products for a number of years. with these acquisitions, we have dramatically increased the percentage of our business that is distributed direct to retail. Our overall revenues grew 58 percent in Europe, with Japan and Australia also posting impressive sales gains. "
Doc1035,ea ,1995," international operations as a whole increased its share of ea revenues from 25 percent to 32 percent in fiscal 1995. we will continue to expand direct distribution capabilities around the world, in our established markets in the us, europe and japan as well as in emerging markets in latin america, asia and the pacific rim. "
Doc1036,ea ,1995," Looking ahead our continued success in fiscal 1996 will depend upon further optimizing our library of 16-bit titles, extending our lead in development of 32-bit titles, driving the growth of our international business, and exploring new opportunities in the on-line arena. "
Doc1037,ea ,1995," We anticipate that industry sales of 16-bit software will decline this year. Our strategy for this segment will be to release fewer titles than in fiscal 1995, while focusing on key franchise properties and product categories. As we did last year, we will market those titles aggressively during the holiday season. "
Doc1038,ea ,1995," At the same time, we believe the 32-bit market will begin to grow rapidly as Sony and Sega bring the PlayStation and Saturn. respectively, to North America and Europe. In the fall of calendar 1995, EA will be ready with strong titles in the sports, simulation, and strategy categories for these platforms. EA Victor released products for both platforms in Japan last year, making Electronic Arts the first company in the industry to publish on all three next-generation platforms. Our goal is to be the leading publisher of entertainment software for CD-ROM based 32-bit systems. "
Doc1039,ea ,1995," Our strategy for international operations is to aggressively expand this part of the organization and our presence in all key markets. We expect strong growth in Europe as Bullfrog adds to its string of hit products and as we continue to build our direct distribution system. Our joint venture in Japan has been successfully established and our capabilities into Southeast Asia. Overall, we expect strong growth from our international business in fiscal 1996. "
Doc1040,ea ,1995," In the area of electronic distribution, we are pursuing two major opportunities: networked interactive gaming, and on-line options for marketing and selling our products. The infrastructure necessary for both gameplay and commercial activities is evolving quickly in the narrow-band area driven by the Internet and on-line network services. We have already launched a home page on the World Wide Web to provide our customers with new product information and exciting promotional opportunities. Development of broadband networks required for interactive television will follow in several years. We are preparing our products, development processes, and Strategies to successfully address these emerging new markets. "
Doc1041,ea ,1995," I would like to close by thanking everyone at EA for the high quality of their work and their continued commitment to excellence. The combination of creative, financial, and management talent at EA is, I believe, unmatched in our industry and gives us a strong foundation for continued success. I would like also to thank you, our stockholders, for your support as Electronic Arts continues to demonstrate its leadership in one of the world's most dynamic entertainment industries. "
Doc1042,ea ,1996,"We achieved many of our goals for fiscal 1996, posting record revenues and emerging as a world leader in sales of interactive software for personal computers. We also added proven development talent to our worldwide creative team and expanded our international distribution infrastructure to new geographic territories. In just six months following the arrival of the PlayStation?? game console in the U.S. market, we generated more than 50 million in revenues on this important new platform. "
Doc1043,ea ,1996," Despite these successes, fiscal 1996 was a challenging year. The North American market accelerated its transition from Sega?? Genesis?? and Super NESW?? cartridge systems to the PlayStation, the Sega Saturn??. and multimedia PCs, and this substantially reduced revenues in an important segment of our business. We offset this anticipated decline by continuing to invest in new platforms such as PCs, the PlayStation, and the Sega Saturn, and in geographic diversification. Expansion of our distribution system overseas helped grow our international revenues by 43% to s226 million for the year. As a result, overall revenues grew 8% to a new high of :53: million. Net income of :40 million was lower than in fiscal 1995, due to increased costs and start-up delays associated with developing and manufacturing more technologically complex products for the new platforms. We believe we have identified the contributing factors, and have taken specific steps designed to improve development efficiency, schedule predictability and profitability in fiscal 1997. "
Doc1044,ea ,1996," RAPID INTERNATIONAL GROWTH Our fundamental strategy for becoming the world's leading interactive entertainment company is to create best-selling products ancl distribute them directly to retailers around the world. For the past 10 years we have steadily built an extensive network of subsidiaries and offices outside North America to localize our products and marketing, and to establish direct relationships with retailers. This strategy is most advanced in Europe, where we have implemented a pan-European distribution network that delivers almost 80% of our products directly to retailers. "
Doc1045,ea ,1996," During fiscal 1996 we successfully integrated last year's acquisitions of Kingsoft GMBH in Germany and DROsoFt in Spain. We also opened EA Nordic in Stockholm, Sweden to distribute EA titles in Sweden. Norway, Finland, Denmark, and Iceland. EA was the market share leader among interactive software publishers in the U.K. and Germany last year, and also published Europe's top-selling title for the year across all interactive platforms, FIFA Soccer 96. At the end of the fiscal year we released Wing Cmmnander The Price of Freedom for the PC to overwhelming response, particularly in Germany. "
Doc1046,ea ,1996," While we grow market share in North America, Europe, and Japan, we are also preparing to move aggressively into the world's  markets. During fiscal 1996 we opened new offices in Malaysia and Singapore, acquired a distributor in South Africa, and began the process of establishing a presence in the People's Republic of China. We have long distributed the Products of other interactive entertainment publishers through our Affiliated Label program. This year we added twentieth Century Fox Home: entertainment, Inc. as a partner, and began distributing Fox Interactive products in international markets. "
Doc1047,ea ,1996," EXPANDED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT Electronic Arts has built one of the industry??s strongest development organizations by hiring and acquiring world-class creative talent. During fiscal 1996 we added Manley 8c Associates of Seattle, washington creator of numerous popular products for EA and other leading publishers.We successfully integrated Bullfrog Productions Ltd., acquired in fiscal 1995, into our worldwide creative team. We also expanded the capacity of our ORIGIN Systems, Inc. studios by opening a new development office in Baltimore, Maryland EA??s worldwide product development community now numbers over 800 employees. "
Doc1048,ea ,1996," In the crowded interactive entertairunent market, strong brands stand out. While continuing to strengthen our core brands such as EA SPORTS, in fiscal 1996 we launched a high-profile new brand For our military and combat products: Jane??s Combat Simulations. Jane's informative Group has been the definitive source of information on military craft and equipment for over one hundred years. Through our exclusive agreement, EA products feature Jane??s All the World??s multimedia reference guide that includes published and unpublished data, images, and rate in-fiight video footage with each product. Our newly released advanced Tartical fight for example, is the only flight simulation that features all seven of the world??s most advanced and experimental jet fighters. "
Doc1049,ea ,1996," TARGETED STRATEGIES IN DIVERGlNG MARKETS Despite the large installed base of Sega Genesis and Super NES game consoles in the US. market, industry sales of 16-bit software cartridges declined approximately 30% last year. In this maturing market, our strategy has been to introduce fewer products each year, Focus on our proven Franchise properties, and advertise them aggressively to maximize sales in the peak selling seasons. For fiscal 1996 we had one of our strongest lineups ever, with Maddm NFL 96, NBA Live 96, NHL 96, College Football USA 96, and triple play baseball 96 all hitting the best-seller lists. As a result, we increased our 16-bit market share from 15% to 17% according to independent industry sources. In fiscal 1997 we expect the decline in the 16-bit cartridge market to accelerate as the replacement market of 32-bit platforms becomes established. We will continue to pursue a selective release strategy backed by high-impact advertising during the holiday season. "
Doc1050,ea ,1996," The market for interactive entertainment software for PCs is broader demographically than the cartridge market, and we believe it will grow steadily at a rate of approximately 15% to 30% next year. Our strategy is to create a rich variety of CD-ROM titles in the major PC categories, including strategy games, simulations. action adventures, and interactive movies, while bringing to due PC the sports properties EA has successfully developed for other game formats. "
Doc1051,ea ,1996," This strategy worked well during fiscal 1996. Revenues from PC-CD products nearly doubled to $141 million in fiscal 1996, compared to $72 million the year before. EA best-sellers for PC included Wing Commander Wing Commander ROAD TRACK the Need for speed, US Navy Fighters, Advanced tactical Fighters, and crusader No Remorse We also successfully moved most of our popular sports properties to PC, including FIFA soccer 96, NBA live 96, NHL. 95, and PGA TOUR 96. "
Doc1052,ea ,1996," The greatest challenge we faced during fiscal 1996 was creating products for the PlayStation and the Sega Saturn. Both systems arrived in the US?? market in 1995, midway through our fiscal year By the end of the calendar year they had a worldwide installed base of approximately six million units, with the majority of those machines in Japan. The 32-bit microcomputer technology in the PlayStation and the Sega Saturn provides much improved graphics, animation, and sound compared to earlier game consoles. At the same time, the more powerful microprocessors present a significantly more complex programming challenge to software developers. "
Doc1053,ea ,1996," During fiscal 1996 we successfully launched 13 products for the PlayStation, including such core Franchises as FIFA soccer 96, NBA Live 96! Road Rash and ROAD TRACK presents the need for speed and finished the fiscal year with three products on the best seller ESQ?? In fact, of the sports products released on the PlayStation this year, FIFA soccer 96, NBA Live 96 and PGA TOUR 96, each was the leading product in its category. However, we did not meet our ambitious goals for the 32-bit market segment primarily because of unanticipated delays in developing and releasing products on these new systems, which specifically affected our extremely popular football and hockey properties. We believe the initial development and manufacturing issues we experienced with the introduction of the PlayStation and the Sega Saturn to the U.S. market are now resolved. We expect to move forward aggressively to establish a leading market share position in this fast-growing segment. "
Doc1054,ea ,1996," LOOKING AHEAD Our primary focus for the next year is to release high quality products for 32-bit game systems and multimedia PCs. We expect that 80% to 90% of our new products will be released on these platforms and will generate 60% to 70% of the Company published revenues. Similar to fiscal 1996, we expect more revenues to come from PC-based products than any other single platform. In the steadily expanding PC-CD segment, our objective is to extend our market share leadership in Europe, improve our strong market share position in the U.S., and move aggressively into the emerging Asian markets. "
Doc1055,ea ,1996," We plan to substantially improve our development schedule predictability for the PlayStation and the Sega Saturn products in fiscal 1997, with a major emphasis on our sports properties. We have already instituted more Precise resource allocation, tighter management of sched- ule milestones, and more in-depth assessment of the technical challenges involved in developing products for the new systems. Our ultimate goal for our 32-bit sports products is to build a market share comparable to what we earlier achieved on the 16-bit cartridge systems. We are also focused on creating simulation and strategy products with enough originality and popularity to become enduring franchise properties in the future. "
Doc1056,ea ,1996," Internationally, we will continue to build our direct distribution capacity. We expect to generate more than 50% of fiscal 1997 revenues outside of North America, up from 42% in fiscal 1996 and 32% in fiscal 1995. "
Doc1057,ea ,1996," We also expect to launch EA into the online multi-player arena, first with a role-playing adventure game designed to allow players around the world to interact in real time. As fiscal 1997 began, hundreds of people participated in a live Internet test of ultima online a multiplayer version of our popular Ultima series. We envision a time when EA customers can go online from any location, at any time, and join other players in EA strategy games, sports tournaments, and combat simulations. This is one of the most exciting developments in interactive entertainment, and Electronic Arts will be at the forefront. "
Doc1058,ea ,1996," I want to thank the extraordinary group of talented, hard-working people at EA who consistently merge compelling content with cutting-edge technology and customer-focused distribution. I would also like to thank you, our stockholders, for your support as Electronic Arts extends its international leadership in one of the world's most exciting entertainment industries. "
Doc1059,ea ,2000,"During fiscal year 2000 Electronic Arts (EA) significantly enhanced its strategic position in the interactive entertainment category. While continuing to create the world??s greatest games on current platforms, EA has taken action to capitalize on technology breakthroughs and to help insulate the company from the cyclical economics that historically impact our industry during console transitions. Despite the console market transition beginning sooner than expected, we continued to grow revenues and profits during the year. We reached an important agreement with America Online, Inc. to be the exclusive provider of games on all AOL sites, increased market share on the critical PC platform, and positioned ourselves for leadership on the next generation of console platforms. "
Doc1060,ea ,2000," By managing the industry??s best development talent, creating strong franchise properties, and expanding our global distribution, we increased revenues and profits in a challenging market environment. Including the results of our new online division, EA.com,(1) consolidated net revenues increased 16 percent to $1,420 million. Consolidated net income, on an as-reported basis, including goodwill and one-time acquisition related charges, increased 60 percent to $117 million; while consolidated diluted earnings per share increased 53 percent to $1.76. "
Doc1061,ea ,2000," Consolidated pro-forma net income,(2) excluding goodwill and one-time acquisition-related charges in both years, increased 14 percent to $130 million. Consolidated pro-forma diluted earnings per share(2) increased 8 percent to $1.95. Our core business, which excludes the results of EA.com, grew pro-forma net revenues(3) 16 percent to $1,401 million. Pro-forma core net income(4) increased 37 percent to $164 million for the core business. "
Doc1062,ea ,2000," strongly positioned on key platforms We had multiple successes on the PC platform in fiscal year 2000. SimCity 3000?? and Command & Conquer??: Tiberian Sun?? each achieved No. 1 status on the PC best-seller list. For calendar year 1999, both products finished in the Top Ten, representing our best performance ever on the PC platform. In addition, we created an outstanding new franchise property The Sims?? which was named Game of the Year by the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences. "
Doc1063,ea ,2000," On the console platforms, our EA SPORTS?? titles maintained a leadership position, with Madden NFL?? 2000 once again winning the all-important football battle in North America. FIFA 2000 dominated the European ??football?? category, with NBA Live 2000, NHL?? 2000, NASCAR??2000, Triple Play 2001, Knockout Kings??2000 and Tiger Woods PGA TOUR?? Golf 2000 all leading in their respective categories. In addition, we bolstered our impressive motorsports lineup by signing a longterm license with Formula One. In March 2000, we released our first F1 products, rounding out the strongest collection of sports properties in our industry. We also secured an exclusive five-year agreement for the James Bond license and will release The World Is Not Enough on multiple platforms in the coming year. In 1999, Tomorrow Never Dies was one of the leading products on the PlayStation?? platform. "
Doc1064,ea ,2000," We further strengthened our Studio organization with the acquisition of DreamWorks Interactive, LLC. DreamWorks developed and published Jurassic Park: The Lost World and released Medal Of Honor??, a best-selling title during the most recent holiday season. We expect to have an ongoing collaboration with DreamWorks SKG, allowing us to create unique and commercially viable content for the interactive entertainment market. "
Doc1065,ea ,2000," Given this unique combination of assets, we believe that Electronic Arts is well positioned to navigate successfully through the transition to the next generation of console technology. Equally important, we view cyclical transition as an opportunity to strengthen and streamline the company, and to clearly establish EA as the market leader of the future. "
Doc1066,ea ,2000," investing for online leadership While still in its infancy, analysts project that online interactive entertainment will generate revenues of up to $2 billion in 2002(,5) an increase of more than 500 percent from $300 million in 1999. During the year, we made a significant investment in EA.com, which we believe will help to establish us as the leading provider of interactive entertainment in the emerging online market. EA.com pro-forma revenues(1) totaled $21 million in fiscal year 2000, with investment spending of $63 million, resulting in a pro-forma net loss(6) of $34 million. We expect that the online portion of our business will continue to generate a net loss in the coming fiscal year, as we position ourselves for this significant new opportunity. "
Doc1067,ea ,2000," In November 1999, we announced a wide-ranging strategic alliance with America Online. The agreement provides Electronic Arts with control of all programming, pricing and promotion on the AOL?? games channel. This is an unprecedented arrangement, which provides EA with immediate access to nearly 60 million online consumers including 22 million AOL subscribers. We have created a separate class of stock, Class B Common Stock (Tracking Stock), to track the performance of the EA.com business, and plan to take this security public at a later date. AOL owns 10 percent of the Class B Common Stock with a warrant for an additional 5 percent ownership. News Corp., as partial consideration for the sale of their Kesmai development group to EA, received 5 percent of the tracking stock. We believe that the partnership with AOL, News Corp., EA Studios and our existing publishing organization is a formidable combination that will facilitate market leadership in this rapidly growing segment of the Internet. "
Doc1068,ea ,2000," strategic goals for the future As we look ahead, we are focused on four strategic initiatives. "
Doc1069,ea ,2000," First, our goal is to be the market leader on the next generation of video game consoles, which includes Sony??s PlayStation??2 computer entertainment system, Microsoft??s Xbox??, and Nintendo??s Dolphin. We shipped our first product for the PlayStation 2 console in Japan in May 2000. Additional titles will be released beginning in the Fall of 2000 in conjunction with the launch of the PlayStation 2 console in North America and Europe. "
Doc1070,ea ,2000," Second, our objective is to be the leading publisher worldwide on the PC platform. We currently hold that position in Europe and Asia Pacific and intend to increase our share in fiscal year 2001. In North America, we believe we can move into the leadership position with a strong portfolio of titles that includes The Sims, Command & Conquer: Red Alert??2, American McGee??s Alice??, Black & White??, The World Is Not Enough, and a full line up of EA SPORTS products. "
Doc1071,ea ,2000," Third, we intend to be the leading provider of interactive entertainment on the Internet. The ability to create compelling content in our Studios and our new EA.com division, along with the unparalleled distribution and reach provided through our partnership with AOL, uniquely positions us for success in this environment. We plan to launch the EA.comSM site in summer 2000, with the full service operational in calendar 2001. "
Doc1072,ea ,2000," Fourth, but most importantly, we strive to be the No. 1 ??people company?? in the entertainment industry. Without doubt, our employees are the lifeblood of our company. They create the award-winning products, market and distribute them more effectively than any competitor, and provide the support functions that enable EA to be the premier company in our industry. It is imperative that our people are well trained, strongly motivated, recognized for their accomplishments and highly productive. We take this challenge seriously and are constantly working to enhance the quality of our organization. "
Doc1073,ea ,2000," We have every confidence that we can achieve each of these strategic objectives, and, in doing so, that we will continue to grow and prosper not only during the current console transition period but also in the years ahead. "
Doc1074,ea ,2000," I would like to acknowledge our employees for their tireless efforts, commitment to excellence and dedication to making EA the worldwide leader in our industry. "
Doc1075,ea ,2000," Finally, I thank our customers and stockholders for their continuing support and trust in Electronic Arts. "
Doc1076,ea ,2001,"Fiscal year 2001 was both a challenging and exciting period for our company and for the industry. The transition f rom the current generation of game consoles to next generation systems continued, marked by the debut of the first entry in the next wave of new technology ? the PlayStation??2 computer entertainment system from Sony. Nintendo and Microsoft will launch new platforms later this year, creating unprecedented levels of competition, creativity and excitement for consumers. Most importantly, this provides a unique opportunity for Electronic Arts to drive revenue and pro fit growth as we move through the next technology cycle. In conjunction with steady increases in the PC market, plus the significant new opportunity in online gaming, we believe Electronic Arts is poised to achieve new levels of success and leadership in the interactive entertainment category. "
Doc1077,ea ,2001," In FY01, consolidated net revenue decreased 6.9 percent to $1,322 million. As a result of our investment in building the leading Internet gaming website, consolidated net income decreased $128 million to a consolidated net loss of $11 million, while consolidated diluted earnings per share decreased $0.96 to a diluted loss per share of $0.08. Pro forma consolidated net income and earnings per share, excluding goodwill, non-cash and one-time charges were $6 million and $0.04, respectively, for the year. "
Doc1078,ea ,2001," LEADERSHIP ON FOUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES EA has established four key strategic initiatives by which we measure our perf o rmance. We pledged to become the number one publisher on next generation consoles, number one on the PC platform, and the number one provider of interactive entertainment on the Internet. Our fourth key initiative is to be the number one ??People Company?? in the entertainment industry. "
Doc1079,ea ,2001, I would like to share with you our assessment of how we performed against each of these strategic initiatives in fiscal year 2001. 
Doc1080,ea ,2001," Strategic Initiative #1   Leadership on Next Generation Consoles Although early in the game, EA has carved out the leading position on the PlayStation 2 console, the first of the next generation consoles. In North America, we achieved a 44 percent market share for this platform during the introductory period through December and maintained a 40 percent share during the March quarter based on dollar sales. In total, we released fifteen new products for this system in less than a six-month period, making EA by far the most prolific publisher for the PlayStation 2 console. We led the best-seller charts with titles and franchises like Madden NFL??, NBA Live and SSX, our new snowboarding game. Both Madden and SSX have already sold more than one million units each on this new platform. In Europe, we estimate we achieved a 35 percent share across all territories on the PlayStation 2 for the calendar year ended December 2000, based on dollar sales, led by FIFA Soccer and SSX. In Japan, our FIFA Soccer World Championship reached number one on the charts, and we firmly established ourselves as the leading US-based publisher in this market. While we do not expect to sustain market share at this level on the PlayStation 2, we have demonstrated our strength in development and publishing and firmly established ourselves as a leader on this console. We have announced support for both the Xbox?? video game console from Microsoft and the Nintendo GameCube??, which will debut later this year. In summary, we succeeded well beyond our expectations on the PlayStation 2; we believe we are well positioned to succeed on Xbox and Nintendo GameCube; and we fully expect to achieve our goal of leadership on next generation consoles. "
Doc1081,ea ,2001," Strategic Initiative #2  Leadership on the PC Platform On the PC platform we made tremendous strides. We grew market share by more than five points in North America, ending the March quarter in the number one position with a 21.6 percent share based on dollar sales. In Europe, we estimate we were the leading company for calendar 2000 with more than a 24 percent share based on dollar sales. In Asia Pacific, we estimate we led in all territories, and we moved to the number two market share position in Japan for the fiscal year. For the second year in a row EA published the number one title in the market  The Sims?? in calendar 2000 and SimCity 3000?? in calendar 1999. The Sims is a global phenomenon; it appeals to a very broad demographic of users, including men, women and children, along with both hard - core and casual gamers. We have sold more than four million units of the core product, and nearly seven million units total when you include expansion packs and data disks. It has become our most important wholly-owned intellectual property, and we plan to continue to develop this franchise with additional expansion packs and an online version in FY02. In addition, we had great success with products like Command & Conquer??: Red Alert?? 2 and Black & White??, both of which have sold more than one million units worldwide to date. "
Doc1082,ea ,2001," Strategic Initiative #3   Be the Leading Provider of Interactive Entertainment on the Internet In the online space we launched EA.com in FY01 and continue to make strong progress towards our goal of leadership in this medium. We acquired Pogo Corporation in Q4, which gives us the ??stickiest?? site on the web for popular entertainment. During the month of March we had more than nine million unique visitors to the EA.com site. Users logged more than 1.7 billion minutes on the EA.com/pogo.comS web sites in March, making this the fifth most heavily trafficked site on the Internet. In the summer we will launch Majestic??, the highly anticipated online thriller, followed by Motor City Online, Earth and Beyond?? and The Sims Online?? later in the fiscal year. We are developing a rich content portfolio; we intend to validate the subscription model for online entertainment; and we are committed to making EA.com a profitable component of our overall business. "
Doc1083,ea ,2001, Strategic Initiative #4   Number One ??People Company?? in the Entertainment Industry We are on track to achieving this goal. We know that industry leadership is predicated on attracting and developing the best talent. We strive to create an environment where people want to work and where great careers are realized. 
Doc1084,ea ,2001," When it comes to re c ruiting talent, we are widely recognized for combining an innovative web-based strategy with a ??high touch?? approach. In just over a year, the career site on our corporate home page has registered more than 50,000 candidates, forming a private talent pool for EA??s ongoing recruitment. "
Doc1085,ea ,2001," We must also retain our best people. We??ve developed EA University to enhance our technical and m a nagement skills. Our proprietary Emerging Leader Program provides management insight and broad business skills to employees who show potential for next generation leadership. We??ve also launched an innovative cross-functional program with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The Creative Leadership Program brings academics and developers together in workshops on narrative, art, and design. In addition, we listen to our people through our Talk Back o rganization feedback process, which allows us to stay in touch with the ever-changing needs of our workforce. "
Doc1086,ea ,2001," These highlighted efforts coupled with industry-leading compensation and reward practices, value-based management practices, and the most up-to-date work environments, are making us a #1 People Company. "
Doc1087,ea ,2001," LOOKING AHEAD: HITS AND INNOVATION historically, the console market has grown by 50 percent or more with each new generation of technology. By most estimates, the next generation of 128-bit machines could develop an installed base of more than 200 million systems worldwide. More hard w a re units translate into more software sales. Also, as gameplay, graphics and audio improve to match the enhanced technology, software tie ratios (the number of software units sold per hardware system) are likely to increase in the future. These are all clear indications of organic growth in our industry. "
Doc1088,ea ,2001," As new entries from Nintendo and Microsoft heat up the competition in console gaming, and as online gaming continues to grow, EA??s primary goal will be to expand on the market leadership we achieved in FY01. Within our industry, EA??s scale allows us the unique ability to leverage intellectual properties across multiple platforms and publish them around the globe. "
Doc1089,ea ,2001," EA??s fundamental strategy is based on creating new hits and innovative products. In FY01, titles like The Sims and SSX along with our lineup of franchises under our EA SPORTS?? brand  Madden NFL??, FIFA Soccer, NHL??, NBA Live, Tiger Woods PGA TOUR??Golf, Triple Play Baseball??, Formula One, Knockout Kings?? and NASCAR?? inspired loyal consumers and drew new audiences to the fun of video games. In FY02 we will release a full slate of potential new hits including NBA STREET, James Bond 007??Agent Under Fire??, Pirates of Skull Cove?? and the first in a series of multiple products based upon the Harry Potter?? property, which EA has licensed exclusively for the video game category. "
Doc1090,ea ,2001," This strategy of hits and innovation will usher in a new age of video gaming. As our core consumers mature and younger gamers enter the market, we??re also seeing greater numbers of women drawn to our products. As technology improves and gameplay adopts deeper story lines and character development, the evolution of video games is accelerating. Interactive entertainment has truly become mainstream entertainment. EA intends to remain at the fore f ront of this exciting and rapidly expanding industry. "
Doc1091,ea ,2001," As always, I want to thank and acknowledge our customers, stockholders and employees for their commitment and ongoing support of Electronic Arts. "
Doc1092,ea ,2002,"In fiscal 2002 we significantly improved our performance versus the previous year and strengthened our position as the industry leader. EA sold more games, captured more market share and generated more revenue than ever before.We capitalized on our strong start in the new console cycle, enhanced our PC business, focused our online operation and grew our portfolio of game franchises. Most importantly, we positioned EA to maintain leadership for the years that lie ahead. "
Doc1093,ea ,2002," Our success is predicated on long-range strategic planning, accurate forecasting, effective risk management and precise execution. EA measures every decision with an understanding that our industry performs in cycles tied to the launch of new hardware platforms.We have exited the very challenging transition period from 32-bit and 64-bit systems to next generation technology that will provide the basis for continued revenue growth and increased profitability. "
Doc1094,ea ,2002," In the late 1990s, EA made three key strategic decisions: "
Doc1095,ea ,2002," We predicted that Sony??s PlayStation??2 computer entertainment system would capture global leadership in the next generation of game consoles. As a result, we concentrated on mastering development for that system, aggressively supporting its launch and becoming the number one publisher for that platform. "
Doc1096,ea ,2002," We believed that next generation consoles from Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft would trigger unprecedented growth and make video games a mainstream force in entertainment.We, therefore, focused our resources on building technology tools and libraries that would allow us to create new products on multiple platforms in a cost-effective manner. "
Doc1097,ea ,2002," We understood that as the company moved through the difficult console transition, we could help insulate our business by generating greater revenue from our PC games and our global distribution capability.We made it a priority to build and acquire new intellectual properties that would drive market share growth on the PC. "
Doc1098,ea ,2002, Our strategic planning and effective execution through this most recent console transition allowed EA to generate outstanding results in fiscal 2002. 
Doc1099,ea ,2002," FISCAL 2002: A YEAR OF LEADERSHIP, GROWTH AND STRATEGIC POSITIONING "
Doc1100,ea ,2002," In the past year, EA strengthened its position as the worldwide leader in interactive entertainment.We grew our business across all markets; we provided compelling software that powered consumer migration to next generation consoles; we strengthened our powerful sports franchises; we developed important new properties; and we signed long-term co-publishing agreements with significant new partners. "
Doc1101,ea ,2002," We increased consolidated net revenue by 30 percent to over $1.7 billion and improved consolidated net income by $113 million to $102 million. Revenues were up in all territories, and in North America we celebrated a major milestone with revenue exceeding $1 billion for the first time. Revenue from our core business increased by 29 percent to over $1.6 billion.With higher sales and focused management of our expenses, operating income from our core business increased $163 million, or 132 percent, over the prior year. Pro forma* net income from our core business increased 106 percent to $217 million, and pro forma net income margin increased five points to 13 percent.We increased EA.com revenue by 83 percent to $77 million and by the fourth quarter had reduced our quarterly pro forma operating expenses by over $16 million compared to the peak quarter in the prior year. "
Doc1102,ea ,2002," EA??s strong performance in fiscal 2002 was made possible by the depth and breadth of our product portfolio and the strength of our worldwide distribution system. Among a year of many blockbusters, three titles stood out: "
Doc1103,ea ,2002," Harry Potter and the Sorcerer??s Stone??   Based on the books and movie, this first game in our multiyear agreement with Warner Bros. became the fastest selling title in EA history. Developed for just four platforms, we sold 9.3 million units worldwide in less than five months. In fiscal 2003, our plans for a new Harry Potter?? game will include next generation consoles for the first time. "
Doc1104,ea ,2002, The Sims??   This wholly-owned franchise is now the best-selling PC game of all time and is popular around the world. Our most valuable intellectual property will continue to deliver significant revenue and high margins in the coming years. 
Doc1105,ea ,2002, Madden NFL??2002   This powerhouse franchise sold over 4.5 million units across eight platforms and was the number one selling console game in North America in fiscal 2002. 
Doc1106,ea ,2002," FISCAL 2002 PERFORMANCE MEASURED BY FOUR KEY INITIATIVES At EA, we??ve established four strategic initiatives for guiding our success.These initiatives are as simple as they are ambitious. Our goals are to be the number one software publisher on next generation consoles; to be number one on the PC; and to be number one online.The fourth key initiative is to make EA the number one people company for high-performance teams and individuals. "
Doc1107,ea ,2002," INITIATIVE #1: LEADERSHIP ON NEXT GENERATION CONSOLES EA was the undisputed global leader on next generation consoles in fiscal 2002. Across all systems we were number one in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. In Japan, we were the leading Western publisher in a market typically dominated by local companies and titles. "
Doc1108,ea ,2002," On the PlayStation 2 console, which established a decisive lead among the new consoles, EA was the number one publisher with 28 percent market share and five of the top ten titles in the U.S. in fiscal 2002. Standout titles included Madden NFL 2002, NBA Street, James Bond 007 in?? Agent Under Fire??, FIFA Soccer 2002 and Final Fantasy??X, which we distribute in North America for our joint venture partner SquareSoft. "
Doc1109,ea ,2002," The year??s biggest headline was the launch of two new and impressive game consoles, the Xbox?? video game system from Microsoft and the Nintendo GameCube??. Between the launch in November to the end of our fiscal year, EA was the number one independent publisher on both the Xbox and Nintendo GameCube in the U.S. "
Doc1110,ea ,2002," By year end, EA stood as the most prolific company on next generation platforms, releasing 18 titles on the PlayStation 2 console, 10 on the Xbox and five on the Nintendo GameCube. "
Doc1111,ea ,2002," INITIATIVE #2: LEADERSHIP ON THE PC EA is the number one entertainment software publisher on the PC in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific, and number two in Japan.We earned a 22 percent market share on the PC in the U.S. and had four of the top five titles in fiscal 2002. "
Doc1112,ea ,2002," The key driver of this success is the ongoing popularity of The Sims.The core product has sold in excess of 6.5 million units and was the best-selling PC game for the second year in a row an extraordinary achievement. The Sims has inspired four expansion packs Livin?? Large, House Party, Hot Date and Vacation to bring total franchise sales to more than 15 million units to date. "
Doc1113,ea ,2002," EA increased PC market share across all territories with the release of other popular titles including Medal of Honor Allied Assault??, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer??s Stone and Command & Conquer Renegade "
Doc1114,ea ,2002," INITIATIVE #3: LEADERSHIP ONLINE In fiscal 2002, we increased EA.comSMrevenue 83 percent; we reduced spending and focused on operational efficiencies; we successfully integrated games and customers from our ad-driven Pogo??site; and we zeroed in on the development of core products such as Earth & Beyond?? and the highly anticipated The Sims Online??. We are working hard to reach profitability and are targeting our first break-even quarter in fiscal 2003 when we release The Sims Online. "
Doc1115,ea ,2002," Based on total minutes served, EA.com is the fourth largest website behind only AOL, MSN and Yahoo!. At the end of our fiscal year, EA.com had more than 13 million unique monthly visitors who spent in excess of 4.6 billion minutes on the site 41 percent of the total U.S. online gaming market. "
Doc1116,ea ,2002," INITIATIVE #4: TO BE THE NUMBER ONE PEOPLE COMPANY FOR HIGH-PERFORMANCE TEAMS AND INDIVIDUALS Our strategy for achieving this goal is to work with the very best talent, to provide training and career development and to offer rewarding compensation and benefit programs.This initiative has enhanced the quality of our organization and has attracted the attention of creative people in other sectors of the entertainment industry. Our human resources function has become a strategic weapon for EA attracting, hiring and retaining the very best talent in our industry.We are committed to making EA the best place to work for people that share our passion for interactive entertainment and performance excellence. "
Doc1117,ea ,2002," BUILDING ON LEADERSHIP IN FISCAL 2003 AND INTO THE NEXT TECHNOLOGY CYCLE Our management team has navigated several cycles of technology transition.We made the difficult decisions that were required to move EA successfully through a challenging period. Now we are well positioned to capture the growth of the new cycle. Revenues from our core packaged goods business will increase, operating margins will expand and our EA.com business will reach its first break-even quarter in fiscal 2003. "
Doc1118,ea ,2002," In fiscal 2003 EA will build on solid franchises and innovate with new titles. Dramatic enhancements and new functionality will appear in blockbuster sports products like FIFA Soccer, Madden NFL Football and NBA Live. Games will be inspired by films like Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, The Lord of the Rings and James Bond. Stunning new versions of classics like SimCity??, Need for Speed?? and Command & Conquer?? will be released. Distribution agreements with entertainment giants like LEGO System A/S, Fox Interactive, LucasArts, SquareSoft and Capcom will enrich our product portfolio. The Sims Online will allow subscribers to create characters, build environments and live out fantasies in a persistent state world. "
Doc1119,ea ,2002," We have long believed that interactive entertainment would grow from a niche market into mainstream entertainment now we are helping to drive that reality. Revenues from a successful game can rival or exceed those of a successful film, and our demographics are becoming as broad as the audience for television. "
Doc1120,ea ,2002," As the industry moves into the ??sweet spot?? of this cycle, EA management is already beginning to plan for the next generation of technology.We are building our team of talented and experienced people, defining our strategic direction and working towards our goal of making EA one of the most exciting and profitable entertainment companies of the 21st century. "
Doc1121,ea ,2002," Finally, I want to thank our employees, business partners, customers and stockholders for their commitment and support of Electronic Arts. "
Doc1122,ea ,2003,"In fiscal 2003, Electronic Arts grew net revenue by 44 percent to $2.5 billion and net income by 212 percent to $317 million. Earnings per share were $2.17. We generated $714 million of operating cash flow and finished the year with $1.6 billion in cash. "
Doc1123,ea ,2003," Rarely in technology or entertainment does the reality match the hype. However, EA continues to meet or exceed the expectations set at the start of this business cycle. The installed base of game consoles is tracking well ahead of the previous generation. Tie ratios of games sold for every unit of hardware are higher and new products are challenging all assumptions about the age and gender of our industry demographics. "
Doc1124,ea ,2003," During the fiscal year, 22 of our titles sold more than one million units and five sold in excess of four million units-an industry record. Worldwide, we are the leading independent publisher on each of the major consoles; we are the number one publisher of PC titles; and we are the leading provider of games on the Internet. "
Doc1125,ea ,2003," EA was recognized by Fortune Magazine as one of the loo Best Companies to Work For in the U.S. The Times in the U.K. and The Globe and Mail in Canada passed similar judgment on our organizations in those countries. We were placed on the 5&P 500, made the Forbes 500, and Business Week rated us number 17 on their list of the 50 Best Performers for the year. "
Doc1126,ea ,2003," Not every goal is achieved and not every game is a hit. However, EA's consistent performance continues to separate us from the competition. Our scale and commitment to developing games for multiple platforms, to focusing resources on franchises with global appeal, and to investing in technology, tools and libraries provide us the opportunity to take creative risks which help drive future growth. "
Doc1127,ea ,2003," While EA is the leader in a thriving industry, our success is not a coincidence. We begin with exhaustive research and take careful measure of our competition. We partner with top licensors and foster our own intellectual properties. We ask tough questions and expect every studio and publishing group to measure progress against exacting standards for achievement and excellence. "
Doc1128,ea ,2003, SETTING OBJECTIVES AS A ROAD MAP FOR SUCCESS We began fiscal 2003 by establishing six key priorities that created a road map to continued industry leadership for EA. 
Doc1129,ea ,2003," FY03 CHALLENGE #1: Drive EA's Harry Potter Franchise Beyond the Record-Breaking Performance of the Previous Year This was an ambitious goal-but it is one we met. During fiscal 2002, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone- became the fastest selling game in EA history. To top that performance with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets;our studio developed an outstanding game on seven platforms and in 31 languages. Our publishing team then launched the game in more than ioo countries on the same day as the release of the Warner Brothers film. The hard work paid off-by the end of fiscal 2003, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets had generated more than $250 million in revenue, a 22 percent improvement over the prior year. "
Doc1130,ea ,2003," FY03 CHALLENGE #2: Restore FIFA as the World's Number One Soccer Franchise introduced in 1994, FIFA Soccer is one of EA's most powerful sports franchises with lifetime revenue of more than $i billion. But competitors were threatening FIFA's leadership. To add to the challenge, EA's 2002 FIFA World Cup-game sold over two million units in the June quartermaking the October launch of a second soccer title even more daunting. To give FIFA an edge, our developers and market researchers met with critics and fans to rediscover what made FIFA great. The resulting game sold more than four million units and was once again the world's best selling soccer title. "
Doc1131,ea ,2003," FY03 CHALLENGE #3: Focus on Growing Intellectual Properties Wholly Owned by EA We've placed a strategic priority on creating and nurturing high-margin properties owned by EA. Fiscal 2003 was a banner year for EA intellectual property, with new games and expansion to new platforms. Our World War II title, Medol of Honor Frontline'; sold more than 4.5 million units. The Sims, an EA product line that has sold more than 25 million units, introduced two expansion packs and an online game for the PC. When The Sims launched on consoles, we showed the world that this was not just a PC phenomenon, but a franchise with multi-platform versatility. We finished the year with a highly successful release of Command & Conquer'MGenerols, another intellectual property with global appeal. "
Doc1132,ea ,2003," FY03 CHALLENGE #4: Win the Holiday Season with Flawless Global Execution in a period of 47 days from October 15 to November 30, EA launched 32 games on a total of seven platforms and sold them in as many as 31 languages and more than ioo countries. No other company could do that; few of them would even try. When the December quarter ended, EA had captured five of the top io titles on the PlayStation2 console, three of the top io on the Xbox'console, two of the top io on the Nintendo GameCube'and five of the top io on the PC in North America. During this period, EA set an industry record by generating more than $1.2 billion in revenue in a single quarter. "
Doc1133,ea ,2003," FY03 CHALLENGE #5: Prove the Online Subscription Business Last year, EA published two subscription-based online games for the PC-Earth & Beyond-and The Sims Online' Both were high quality games that received positive reviews from critics. However, neither met our expectations for sales and subscription. Despite the disappointment, the experience has not diminished our willingness to take creative risks. We are very proud of these games. "
Doc1134,ea ,2003," In fiscal 2003, EA consolidated the operations of our online division into our core operations. We took a pre-tax charge of $67 million as a result of impaired assets and restructuring costs in the online division. We're not abandoning online games-far from it. However, going forward our online activities will be more closely integrated into our console and PC business. "
Doc1135,ea ,2003," We learned some hard but useful lessons from this experience. In hindsight, we spent too much, and we did it too early in the cycle. However, we believe that in the coming months and years, online play will become an increasingly important feature in console games. While we don't expect console online play to reach mass market proportions on this generation of technology, more than 450,000 fans have already registered to play Madden NFCFootball and NBA LIVE online on the PlayStation 2 console. "
Doc1136,ea ,2003," FY03 CHALLENGE #6: Build on the Leadership of EA SPORTS' Sports games are the core of EA's business, providing a recurring annual revenue stream and powerful recognition for our trademark around the world. Title by title, year by year, we have built a commanding lead. "
Doc1137,ea ,2003," Fiscal 2003 began with competitors, critics and even diehard fans whispering that the EA SPORTS brand could lose its leading position in the football, basketball, racing and soccer categories. But when those seasons ended, we not only held our position, we actually grew our sports business across all major platforms. EA's Madden NFL Football, NCAAFootball, FIFA Soccer, NBA LIVE and NASCAR Thunder-franchises all achieved lopsided victories and confirmed that when faced with competition, EA SPORTS would not only defend, but extend its leadership. It was an extraordinary achievement-and one that set a new standard for teamwork and performance at EA. "
Doc1138,ea ,2003," A ROAD MAP FOR FY04 AND BEYOND Rest assured, we have a new and equally ambitious set of goals that define our road map for fiscal year 2004. Build on EA's intellectual property portfolio with games like Medol of Honor-Rising Sun, The Sims 2 and SSX3. Invest in development of new, wholly owned game properties. Increase EA SPORTS worldwide market leadership. Fully exploit EA titles tied to major movie licenses: The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and )omes Bond. Leverage the advantage of EA's online experience and infrastructure. Attack new opportunities with investments in people, process and technology. "
Doc1139,ea ,2003," Our preparation and vision take us far beyond the current generation of console systems. Today, many of EA's top engineers and business planners are building models and strategies for the new technology, new audiences and new game experiences that will extend EA's leadership and reshape interactive entertainment. "
Doc1140,ea ,2003," We see more powerful consoles, faster PC's, high-definition television, theatre-quality sound and broadband connectivity- new game systems that will take us beyond anything we've seen, felt or experienced in the past. "
Doc1141,ea ,2003," Imagine Madden NFL Football or The Sims in that environment! At the heart of the revolution in digital entertainment is the software-the games, movies and music that make the technology come alive. In our industry, each new generation of technology provides developers with an enhanced canvas for creating more compelling entertainment experiences. Game platforms-faster consoles and PC's-create fantastic opportunities, but it's the software that provides the magic. "
Doc1142,ea ,2003," At EA, we're the world's leading developer and publisher of interactive entertainment-the software that breathes life into the hardware. Our global scale and reach, our ability to adapt and plan, our commitment to empower the very best people with the very best place to work, keep us on a path to our ultimate goal: To be the greatest entertainment company... ever! "
Doc1143,ea ,2003," To conclude, I would like to thank our employees, customers, business partners and stockholders for their ongoing commitment and support of Electronic Arts. "
Doc1144,intuit ,1996,The Internet is a sea change. It?? s not the normal technology change that occurs every year. The Internet is a shift of giant proportion. The best response is to recognize the shift quickly and act decisively. This we are doing to unlock new opportunity for Intuit. 
Doc1145,intuit ,1996," This letter summarizes the changes and the achievements of the year, and briefly describes how Intuit is using the Internet. "
Doc1146,intuit ,1996," In fiscal 1996, revenues increased 28% to $538.6 million, up from $419.2 million in the previous year, reflecting strength across key parts of Intuit??s core businesses. Income from continuing operations, excluding acquisition related charges, increased to $32.2 million in fiscal 1996. In fiscal 1995, income from continuing operations, excluding acquisition related charges and the Microsoft merger termination fee, was. $27.5 million. Results reflect a higher mix of aggressively priced OEM sales, increased investments in new businesses and increased customer service costs. "
Doc1147,intuit ,1996," Intuit??s mission is improving the financial lives of consumers, small businesses, and financial providers. Our business has two characteristics: One, we choose markets where people's needs are durable and long-lived. ;Two, we target businesses where there is exciting opportunity. Opportunity possible because the pace of technology enables us to serve people's needs in better and better ways. "
Doc1148,intuit ,1996," Let's start -with tax, Intuit??s largest business. Tax demand is durably reliable, just like taxes Further, annual tax changes require customers to re-buy each year. "
Doc1149,intuit ,1996," In fiscal 1996, Intuit??s tax teams led us to new record highs in revenue in units sold, in share of retail sales, and in profits. Tax profitability leapt up, with contribution as a percent of sales growing by over 10 points in our TurboTax and ProSeries?? businesses. I'm so proud of the work by our tax people in San Diego, Cedar Rapids, Edmonton, Fredericksburg, Tucson, and Munich; "
Doc1150,intuit ,1996," In the fiscal year we began delivering state income tax solutions via the World Wide Web; This is just the beginning of using the Internet to re-engineer the tax process, further eliminating the hassle of taxes, and growing the share of. tax returns prepared with Intuit technology "
Doc1151,intuit ,1996," In Quicken we are fortunate to have a business which both acquires new. customers for Intuit and generates profits. Some companies spend a fortune to acquire new customers, in some cases spending $100 per new customer or more. In contrast, Quicken is a customer acquisition engine that generates profits, too. "
Doc1152,intuit ,1996," Quicken gives Intuit an asset of over 9 million active users, up from 8 million last year, which is a key driver in the success of many of our new businesses: QuickBooks, the Quicken Financial Planner and Intuit??s new on-line businesses, This is why we manage the ??Quicken business for customer acquisition, even when that means pricing that lowers current revenue growth and profits, as it did in fiscal 1996 "
Doc1153,intuit ,1996," This year the Quicken teams made a giant leap with Quicken for 97 which debuts October 24, 1996. Its new design is stunning. Quicken for '97 pioneers new ground in combining the best of the Internet with?? the best of client software. Quicken delivers speed of use that the Internet alone just can't on dial-up lines. And the Internet gives Quicken up-to-the minute currentness  delivering late-breaking financial, news, stock quotes, and more, including a unique system that brings the ??best of the Web's?? financial sites right into Quicken. "
Doc1154,intuit ,1996," Business Products Small businesses must keep books. Capturing more of this durable demand has become an increasingly important part of our business. Intuit technology now does the books, taxes, or both for over 3/2 million businesses and is used most often by the business onmer. Only a handful of firms worldwide reach so many businesses and business owners "
Doc1155,intuit ,1996," In fiscal 1996, our QuickBooks business achieved new record highs in revenue, in units sold, in share of retail sales, and in profits. I'm so impressed with the QuickBooks teams?? progress in customer learning, product design, engineering process, tech support, and marketing. One success was the introduction of QuickBooks Pro. Pro??s average selling price is twice that of basic QuickBooks, which improved profit margins. "
Doc1156,intuit ,1996, QuickBooks Pro??s success shows the potential for more advanced business products and services to reach new markets at higher price points. We are spending to develop these technologies in fiscal ??1997 for shipment in subsequent fiscal years. 
Doc1157,intuit ,1996," Electronic Financial Services Eighteen months ago Intuit worked with only a handful of financial institutions in the United States. Now Intuit software or Web sites, are used by over 100 US. financial providers and more providers overseas. In the U.S., these relationships include 40 financial institutions,?? over 60 mutual fund families, and 5 insurance companies. This list includes 11 of the top 20 domestic banks. Intuit??s insurance progress comes from collaboration with Interactive Insurance Services, a company we acquired in June 1996. The results in mutual funds come from a longer collaboration with GALT' Technologies, a company we acquired in September 1996. "
Doc1158,intuit ,1996," International Intuit's penetration of international markets has increased, paced by growing adoption of PCs worldwide, While this work has .been difficult and expensive, Quicken is now in 15 countries outside the United States and tax is in 4. Small businesses are a particular focus since in every country businesses must keep books. In Japan, Intuit merged with Milkyway,,a leading accounting software maker, to address this growing segment in one of the largest markets in the world. Also in the year we successfully launched QuickBooks in Germany, as well as Quicken in France and Spain. "
Doc1159,intuit ,1996," Parsons When we acquired Parsons Technology in fiscal 1995, we saw great potential, not only in Parsons products, but in Parsons?? mastery of direct marketing skills. This year for example, Parsons grew legal title unit volume 65% via direct and retail marketing of the Quicken Family Lawyerm and the new Quicken Business Law Partner "
Doc1160,intuit ,1996," Coping with legal and regulatory requirements is one of those durable realities of life. Legal?? software is already Parsons?? largest business, and we have only begun to apply technology and the ??Internet to ease the burden of complyinglwith government rules "
Doc1161,intuit ,1996," Financial Supplies Intuit Financial Supplies group again delivered substantial growth and new record highs in revenues and profits. This was paced by dramatic process, re-engineering that moves orders directly to the printing plate, .saving costs and slashing delivery time by four days. Supplies?? phone staff has focused on selling producing sizable increases in average order size. "
Doc1162,intuit ,1996," Sales, Service and Operations 1996 was a year of tremendous achievement by Intuit??s, customer support, sales, and service organizations. "
Doc1163,intuit ,1996, Intuit??s retail sales organization led us all on one of Intuit??s core values:.do right by the customer. Their expertise and trusted relationships led to new ways to build our customers?? revenue and profit. 
Doc1164,intuit ,1996," Intuit??s service, teams moved to integrating sales with service, paced by the Parsons, Supplies, ProTax and Direct Sales and Service groups. This was aided by vastly better matching of workforce to the 5X swings in call volume we receive. The result is less time on hold and more time to serve and sell "
Doc1165,intuit ,1996," Powerful Web sites take technical support, too. Intuit??s Alexandria and Fredericksburg units have pioneered tech support for Intuit??s lnsureMarket Web site with advanced software enabling our phone support people to see the page the caller is using "
Doc1166,intuit ,1996," Operations pioneered innovative ways of distributing new products. For example, virtual warehousing significantly reduced time to market for new products. "
Doc1167,intuit ,1996," At the same time, Intuit??s service costs are higher than we want. Our goals are to provide these service levels at significantly lower cost. "
Doc1168,intuit ,1996," Management As we have grown to about 3500 employees, the management team, under Bill Campbell's tremendous leadership, has grown in its capability and leadership. To that end, Bill has organized a senior management team of Executive VP Bill Harris managing our Tax and Financial Services businesses, Senior  Eric Dunn leading our Quicken, Banking and International groups, Senior VP Jim Heeger managing our Finance, Operations and Customer Services teams, Senior VP John Monson heading our Small Business and Financial Supplies initiatives, VP Alan Gleicher running sales, and VP of Human Resouyrces Mike Ahearn, all reporting to Bill Campbell. To this group of executives falls the responsibility of developing the generation of leaders capable of capitalizing on the changes in our businesss "
Doc1169,intuit ,1996," Sale of lntuit Services Corporation On September 16, 1996 we announced the sale of our private network hub and bill payment processing operation to CheckFree Corporation (see page 31 of the enclosed Form 10K for more detail). We concluded that we weren't world class  as we needed to be in  high volume transaction processing. These businesses were retarding the acceptance of our other efforts by financial institutions and they were painfully diverting money and management time from the businesses we are really good at. At closing, Intuit will receive CheckFree stock worth over $250 million at today's market value, a five-fold return on our total investment in a business we were in for just over two years. "
Doc1170,intuit ,1996," Instead of using only ISC??s private network, we will use the Internet for connectivity to Quicken and other products. This communication will use protocols open to all financial institutions, processors, and software firms - a set of protocols called OpenExchange "
Doc1171,intuit ,1996, The Internet and the Future I can summarize our first year of lntemet learning in three points 
Doc1172,intuit ,1996, The Internet means change. Those who don't change will get left behind. 
Doc1173,intuit ,1996," The Internet means choice. Alternatives are now just a click away. Those who aren't best of breed, and don't enable their customers to use the best of breed will get left behind. That's the lesson we learned from our billpay business. "
Doc1174,intuit ,1996," The Internet does not change people's fundamentals. Their hopes and fears, their passions and pains, and their financial needs remain profound and durable. "
Doc1175,intuit ,1996," Intuit's mission remains profound and durable: to change for the better how people and small businesses manage their financial lives. And to change for the better how financial providers reach, sell, and serve many of their most attractive prosects. "
Doc1176,intuit ,1996," What does the future hold The Internet opens exciting new opportunities, often the result of??the collaboration of many companies via open standards, like OpenEXchange "
Doc1177,intuit ,1996," Taxes will be re-engineered so data like 1099's flows in electronically, delivering completed tax filings with very few keystrokes and no paper. One??s portfolio and spending records will similarly be automatic. Businesses will send bills electronically and have payments booked automatically, saving money and time. "
Doc1178,intuit ,1996," Technology will aid making confident decisions in a financial world that's increasingly complex. These include making decisions on insurance; as we're pioneering with our InsureMarket Web site and major carriers including State Farm, Allstate, Zurich/Kemper, -and John Hancock. And decisions on mutual funds, as we're pioneering with our NETworth Web site together with dozens of fund families. And decisions on retirement and 401 (k) planning, as we've announced we're pioneering with Fidelity Investments. "
Doc1179,intuit ,1996," Internet-driven software will enable one??s trusted financial advisor to know when and how to serve the client better. For financial providers, electronic channels will become essential to reach a growing segment of upscale customers. These channels will use technology and trust to acquire customers and build revenues at lower cost to the financial provider. "
Doc1180,intuit ,1996," None of this future is easy or inevitable. Great progress will be achieved only through the energy, inventiveness and teamwork of the people of Intuit and our partner companies. "
Doc1181,intuit ,1997,"As we begin 1998, l am struck by one constant: change, largely driven by the Internet. The Internet is enabling us to revolutionize the future of finance in many ways, benefiting consumers, businesses, and the financial institutions that serve them. This letter will focus on that future. "
Doc1182,intuit ,1997, Entrepreneurial teams of lntuit people are making great strides in expanding our leadership in revolutionizing financial management. 
Doc1183,intuit ,1997, We are doing this in three ways: 
Doc1184,intuit ,1997," We are creating new, entirely Web-based businesses that enable people to save time and money and enable financial institutions to attract new customers at lower cost. "
Doc1185,intuit ,1997," We are creating new, entirely Web-based businesses that enable people to save time and money and enable financial institutions to attract new customers at lower cost. "
Doc1186,intuit ,1997, We are connecting customers to the world of financial resources around us. 
Doc1187,intuit ,1997, We are continuing to popularize PC-based financial management. 
Doc1188,intuit ,1997," And, Intuit people are doing all this at Internet speed - fast. "
Doc1189,intuit ,1997, intuit is building a new community of entirely Web-based businesses where we are the customer champion for financial decisions. Let me begin to describe it with a true story. 
Doc1190,intuit ,1997," One of our people, Roy, just shopped for car insurance. He spent half a day of time and hassle calling insurers, answering the same questions over and over. The results were amazing; the high quote was $1000 per year over the lowest. He was stunned that an insurer famous for low prices quoted him the highest price! ln the end Roy picked a mid-price policy to get an insurer known for service, and saved himself $700 a year over his prior policy. A $700 savings every year. "
Doc1191,intuit ,1997," Now imagine what it would be like if Roy could have done this on the Internet, in 20 minutes, on a single website. "
Doc1192,intuit ,1997," What you're imagining is a new kind of business made possible because of the lnternet. And being made a reality by Intuit. We call this being the customer champion. It's just one part of what we're building at our Quicken.com website today. (Quotes for term life insurance are already on Quicken.com. And, we're working on auto insurance right now.) "
Doc1193,intuit ,1997," We describe Quicken.com as the objective Source to make the most of your money, for consumers and for small businesses. Someday you will simply click on Quicken.com when making important financial decisions for such things as mortgages and business loans; insurance for auto, life, and business; investments and mutual funds; retirement planning; getting out of debt; selecting business services; and more. l??m delighted that six of these are already live on Quicken.com today. "
Doc1194,intuit ,1997, lntuit is building Quicken.com to be the best place to: 
Doc1195,intuit ,1997, Track and manage multiple aspects of your finances 
Doc1196,intuit ,1997, Get answers to financial questions with impartial information 
Doc1197,intuit ,1997, See apples-to-apples comparisons of financial products from many top financial institutions 
Doc1198,intuit ,1997, Purchase financial products with just a click 
Doc1199,intuit ,1997, Share ideas and learn from financial experts and others via community 
Doc1200,intuit ,1997, Get financial information personalized to your interests and needs 
Doc1201,intuit ,1997, Conveniently do all this 24 hours a day from your home or office 
Doc1202,intuit ,1997," Quicken.com enables financial institutions to find and acquire new customers at low cost. Mutual funds, insurance, and lending are some of the most fragmented industries in the world. There are thousands of firms competing to find and acquire the new customers they need to grow. Leading institutions are using Quicken.com to gain market share and lower their costs. Plus, we license our technology to financial institutions, supplying them the tools to quickly field a compelling and superior web presence. In turn, intuit earns growing advertising and marketing revenue. "
Doc1203,intuit ,1997, lntuit is creating a channel for financial institution partners to reach and attract some of the most financially active and attractive customers on the Internet. These customers include: 
Doc1204,intuit ,1997," Our QuickBooks, Quicken, and TurboTax customer bases of over 9 million households and over 3 million business owners "
Doc1205,intuit ,1997," The financial traffic from Excite, one of the world's most frequently visited websites "
Doc1206,intuit ,1997," intuit is a company of entrepreneurs, pioneering new Web-based businesses. We are moving forward at a rapid pace, although early success in building our site may not show up in current financial results. Today, internet-based revenue represents under 5% of overall company revenue, though we believe that the dramatic growth of the internet will give us significant opportunities to grow our business over the next several years. "
Doc1207,intuit ,1997," At intuit, we are moving our traditional businesses to the connected world - connecting today's desktop software to the vast array of internet resources. We are doing this across the entire company. For example, our Quicken team just launched Quicken '98, which: "
Doc1208,intuit ,1997, Automatically tracks your bank account and credit card activity 
Doc1209,intuit ,1997, Effortlessly updates your investment portfolio from top brokerage firms 
Doc1210,intuit ,1997, Gets the latest online news and research about your investments 
Doc1211,intuit ,1997, Accesses online apples-to-apples comparisons from top insurance companies and mortgage lenders 
Doc1212,intuit ,1997," in addition, we are piloting electronic bill presentment. Quicken '98 is the first software to support electronic bill delivery. When companies begin to send bills electronically to customers, Quicken '98 is already set up to receive them. "
Doc1213,intuit ,1997, Another breakthrough is the way intuit's tax team is working to re-engineer the tax process from beginning to end. 
Doc1214,intuit ,1997," imagine it is April 15 and you need to do your taxes, but Seinfeld is on. "
Doc1215,intuit ,1997," A commercial starts and you click on the TurboTax site at Quicken.Com. Up pops your tax return with all the entries already there! TurboTax automatically collected your data from your bank, your broker, and your employer. You scan the return and see that the data is correct. With a click you file your tax return and receive a confirmation of receipt from the lRS. The commercial is over. Your taxes are done, You're back to Seinfeld. "
Doc1216,intuit ,1997," Although it will take years to complete this vision, lntuit will deliver some of the pieces this year. ln fiscal 1998, we will be offering a completely Web-based tax preparation service, TurboTax Online. This website will enable people to prepare and file their returns entirely online. "
Doc1217,intuit ,1997," Electronic filing with return receipt is already real. ln fiscal 1997, TurboTax, MaclnTax, and ProSeries users filed approximately 600,000 returns electronically. Today, you can also download the complete federal and state tax return packages directly from the Internet. And, updates to any of our tax software are available online. "
Doc1218,intuit ,1997," At Intuit, we are working to make this revolution a reality. "
Doc1219,intuit ,1997," intuit people continue to lead in popularizing PC-based financial management. ln 1984, we introduced Quicken, the first software to help people organize and manage their finances with ease. Also in 1984, we repeated this success with the introduction ofTurboTax. Again, in 1992, we launched QuickBooks, revolutionary accounting software for small businesses. ln each case, we started small and grew a hugely popular business. Today, all three products each command over 70% share of sales in their category at retail. "
Doc1220,intuit ,1997," Now, let me talk about the opportunity in small business. Every business in every country must account for its financial activity - every month. But, most small businesses would rather focus on the business and not on the financial paperwork. As a result, small businesses are asking us to automate more and more of their financial work. "
Doc1221,intuit ,1997," Today, we are working on a networked version of QuickBooks, which will enable multiple people to use the software at the same time. This is the single, most-requested feature from small businesses. Scheduled to launch at the end of this fiscal year, the new multi-user version will enable us to reach a whole new segment of the market we've not been able to serve up to now. "
Doc1222,intuit ,1997," Not only are we adding value to our QuickBooks products, but we are also expanding our market presence. For the first time in its history, QuickBooks has achieved an 80% share of retail sales in the United States and boasts more than one and a half million users. Extending our small business efforts internationally, we completed the acquisition of Nihon Micom, a Japanese small business accounting software company, in March 1997. We combined Nihon Micom with our other Japanese subsidiary, Milkyway, to form Intuit K.K., now the largest PC accounting software company in Japan. "
Doc1223,intuit ,1997, l'm proud of an Internet advance from our Financial Supplies Group. Now customers can order checks and invoice forms on our website. These online orders are processed electronically and go directly to the printing plate. This speeds delivery to customers while cutting the labor and costs involved. 
Doc1224,intuit ,1997," Over the past year, we have shed non-strategic businesses and transitioned to an online focus. During fiscal 1997, we sold our bill payment electronic processing operation, intuit Services Corporation, to Checkfree Corporation, and, in August 1997, we sold our direct marketing subsidiary, Parsons Technology, inc., to Broderbund Software, lnc. "
Doc1225,intuit ,1997," Our financial performance in fiscal 1997 benefited from an increased emphasis on profitability. Annual revenue grew 11% to approximately $599 million, while pro forma net income, excluding the net of acquisition, restructuring, and divestiture related charges, was up more strongly by 18%, to approximately $38 million. "
Doc1226,intuit ,1997," Let me close by celebrating intuit??s many entrepreneurs for driving change in new ways - creating a robust Internet community, establishing our role as customer champion on the Web, integrating online functionality into our software, increasing value in our small business offerings  and at a new pace. "
Doc1227,intuit ,1998,"How will you invest in the year 2005? Or borrow money? What about buying a car and insuring it? Filing your taxes? Or paying your employees? The internet is transforming these financial activities and intuit is at the forefront of this revolution. During the past year, we realized many pieces of that vision and are making more of it a reality each day. "
Doc1228,intuit ,1998," ln the fourth quarter, we expanded our profitable professional tax preparation software business with the acquisition of Lacerte Software Corporation. Acquired for $400 million, Lacerte is the third largest provider of tax software for professional preparers with approximately 30,000 customers "
Doc1229,intuit ,1998," Now, 1 in 5 of all individual tax returns are prepared using intuit products. "
Doc1230,intuit ,1998," We also delivered on our commitment to improve lntuit??s financial performance. By focusing on cost reductions and operating efficiencies, we exceeded our pro forma profitability goal. We improved our pro forma operating results by 38% and delivered a full 2-point improvement to the pro forma operating margin. Moreover, Quicken had its most profitable year ever. Our GAAP performance reflected charges that resulted in a loss (see page 40 in the attached Form 10-K). "
Doc1231,intuit ,1998," More importantly, we achieved these financial results while significantly investing in new Internet products and services. We forged alliances with leading Web portals (Excite, AOL, CNNfn), extended our relationships with financial institutions, and partnered to bring Quicken.com capabilities to Canada, Gemiany, and the UK. "
Doc1232,intuit ,1998," Throughout the year, we deployed our technology and software expertise to enrich our Quicken.com Internet offerings. We added QuickenMortgage, providing online shopping and application for mortgages from fifteen of the nation??s top lenders. We launched auto insurance on Quicken lnsureMarket and today, consumers in many states can shop, purchase, and bind auto insurance with Travelers insurance or Electric insurance all online. We expanded our online tax offering, enabling people to prepare and file their simple Federal taxes on the Web. in June we launched Quicken.com for Small Business, the first such site to be devoted entirely to the financial needs of 22 million small businesses. And, we increased the rich investment features on Quicken.com with in-depth functionality and added resources. "
Doc1233,intuit ,1998, We have achieved these accomplishments because of lntuit??s people and our entrepreneurial philosophy about empowering people. Let me describe how it works. 
Doc1234,intuit ,1998," First, we hire great people. Then, we give them responsibility and ownership to create great things. We help people grow and we reward their achievements. At intuit, it??s the people. "
Doc1235,intuit ,1998," The entrepreneurial environment here is a high-energy atmosphere that commands innovation and spontaneity. it enables people to make a big difference. For example, during a job interview a prospective product manager made several suggestions regarding improvements to the user interfaces in Quicken. Two hours later the candidate stopped to visit with the interviewer and saw that his suggestions were already implemented in a prototype and up and running on the screen. His thoughts - ??l knew right away that this was the place I had to work!?? "
Doc1236,intuit ,1998," At intuit, people are able to advance and develop - and for those who make the most of these opportunities, many move faster and farther than they had expected. "
Doc1237,intuit ,1998," For example, the group manager of our mortgage efforts has advanced through four levels of the organization. Rapid advancement considering she has been here just over two years, and right out of business school. "
Doc1238,intuit ,1998," ln another example, our Vice President of Direct Marketing and Sales started as a marketing communications manager. Since then, she has held positions in international sales and marketing and business development for Web-based personal finance. "
Doc1239,intuit ,1998," lntuit's senior managers understand our whole business, not just one piece of it. So we educate, inform, and actively move people around. The Senior Vice President of our Small Business Division has been with the company for four years and ran Operations, our Financial Supplies Group, was CFO, and is now responsible for our largest division. "
Doc1240,intuit ,1998," For some, advancement means literally ??moving around. One employee who started as a temporary customer service phone representative in San Diego, advanced to the level of supervisor, then moved to the UK, then headed to France and Germany as we established new offices there. He then went to Japan. Each time, he expanded his knowledge and responsibilities while remaining focused on his specialty, providing great customer service. "
Doc1241,intuit ,1998," There are many such examples. At lntuit, people make the difference. "
Doc1242,intuit ,1998, Now l??d like to discuss another key success factor for Intuit - our unwavering customer focus. 
Doc1243,intuit ,1998, Our goal is not just customer satisfaction but to go beyond satisfaction and WOW our customers. 
Doc1244,intuit ,1998," Just look at these user comments for one of our lnternet services, QuickenMortgage: ' ... the information generated based on my preferences was a great convenience to me in helping me to find the right loan for myself and my family Keep up the great work  it's the people at Intuit Inc. that give your company such a great image in the eyes of the public. ?? "
Doc1245,intuit ,1998, And from another QuickenMortgage customer... ??Fantastic tool for comparison shopping. Made my search very quick and easy.?? 
Doc1246,intuit ,1998," Unwavering customer focus, that is exactly what we do at lntuit. We have well over 5 million customer contacts per year, whether on customer support phone calls or through our website. Our research programs, beta tests, and usability labs put us in touch with thousands more every year to get their input and make our products better. "
Doc1247,intuit ,1998," The results Many of Quicken??s 10 million users have a powerful experience, making changes to their lives. While you may not have the same experience, here's what just a few of them have said: ??You kept me out of bankruptcy?? Now I can afford to send my kid to college.?? ??You saved my marriage. ?? "
Doc1248,intuit ,1998," We seek not just to deliver Wow! to our customers, but to our employees and business partners as well. Business partners are a key part of our success. Let's take a look at how partnering works at lntuit... "
Doc1249,intuit ,1998," With our business partners, lntuit takes a team approach, helping each partner succeed and thereby helping the partnership succeed, a win-win-win approach. We actively seek solutions where lntuit wins, our partners win, and our customers win. When all three work, powerful results can happen. "
Doc1250,intuit ,1998," The Quicken Tax Freedom Project is an example of a win-win-win partnership with the IRS. The IRS wants to stop the blizzard of paper that buries them each year. Taxpayers hate the drudgery of preparing paper-based tax returns. Doing it all electronically is the answer for both, and something that lntuit does well. "
Doc1251,intuit ,1998," Thanks to the entrepreneurs on our tax team, intuit recently announced that we are offering online tax preparation and electronic filing for FREE to millions of lower-income Americans. Taxpayers win. The IRS wins. And Intuit wins. "
Doc1252,intuit ,1998," We are helping our banking partners succeed, by connecting them with their customers over the lnternet. Banks spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year processing paper checks. Consumers hate spending their weekends paying bills and writing checks. Doing it all electronically is the answer. "
Doc1253,intuit ,1998," Today, intuit has over one million customers paying bills and conducting their banking online, accessing their financial institutions via intuit products. We currently work with over 80% of the 30 largest financial institutions ln the United States, which account for over 50% of all checking accounts in the country. We save both our financial institution partners and our customers time, money, and hassle. "
Doc1254,intuit ,1998," Where can we go from here in the professional tax arena, we are embedding lnternet connections in our professional tax products so tax preparers will be able to communicate electronically with their small business clients?? accounting records. The ciient??s QuickBooks information will automatically be entered in lntuit??s ProSeries or Lacerte tax software - all via the lnternet. Once again, saving tax professionals and small businesses time and hassle. "
Doc1255,intuit ,1998," Sometimes we??re able to leverage our strong balance sheet to aid a business partner. Recently, we helped a major strategic partner by loaning them $50 million to close a key business deal. Our speedy response gave them time to arrange sound financing and repay our loan. intuit benefited by making this partner stronger, our partner benefited by closing a major deal. "
Doc1256,intuit ,1998," Now, on to what we are doing in the online world... "
Doc1257,intuit ,1998," One of the most far-reaching technology developments in this century is the advent of the lnternet. The lnternet is especially suited to financial activities, unlocking unique opportunities never before imagined. "
Doc1258,intuit ,1998," Today, intuit is developing exciting new technologies to make it easier to manage your finances on the lnternet. Because many financial transactions consist of data transmitted electronically, there is no need for physical delivery of a product. "
Doc1259,intuit ,1998, The lnternet is part of the fabric of all we create. it drives our new Web-based businesses. We are taking our powerful software engines and deploying them on the Web. And similarly embedding Web-based capabilities in our desktop software. 
Doc1260,intuit ,1998," Revolutionizing Payroll Services As a team of entrepreneurs, lntuit??s Small Business Division is revolutionizing financial services for employers, saving money and eliminating hassle for millions of small businesses. "
Doc1261,intuit ,1998," We??ve formed a separate team of entrepreneurs entirely focused on employer services and launched our lnternet-based QuickBooks Online Payroll Service in October 1998.The payroll service enables small businesses to enter salary information into their QuickBooks software and then transfer this information over the lnternet to intuit. From there, the payroll is automatically processed, including arranging deposits to employee accounts, paying the taxes, and filing the payroll tax returns. just enter, click, and you're done. At a fraction of the time, effort, and money that traditional systems entail. "
Doc1262,intuit ,1998," And this is just the beginning. imagine how we can use the lnternet to revolutionize pension, 401K, health, disability insurance, and sales and income taxes. "
Doc1263,intuit ,1998," Revolutionizing Tax Process In the tax arena, our vision is simply ??the two-minute tax return.?? "
Doc1264,intuit ,1998," Someday, in the future, you could sit down at your computer, go to Quicken.com, identify yourself, and see your tax return complete itself, all on screen. ln fiscal 1998, we took the first step in this bold new direction with the introduction of Web TurboTax, a Web-based tax preparation product for basic 1040 returns. "
Doc1265,intuit ,1998," Today we are expanding this capability to include the full range of returns, federal and state - all online. "
Doc1266,intuit ,1998," To make the two-minute tax return a reality requires the coordination of private enterprise and the government. intuit is working with selected financial institutions on technical and legislative issues. We are pursuing government approval for 100% paper free returns, eliminating the requirement for physical signatures. And for approval of electronic payment for taxes due. Another of the key elements we will be working on is the download of Form 1099 information to servers that can be automatically accessed by Web-based tax software. "
Doc1267,intuit ,1998," Revolutionizing Financial Management The growing number of electronic connections required to manage numerous financial relationships on the lnternet confronts consumers on a daily basis. intuit is working with new technologies that will transform the often painful, time-consuming task of data entry into quick and easy decision management activities. Someday you will pay your phone, rent, and utility bills all while on vacation, automatically. "
Doc1268,intuit ,1998," For example, intuit is an early supporter of Open Internet Billing, a model that combines standards-based communication links with new Web software to allow billers to reach their customers directly through the lnternet. With broad implementation, Open lnternet Billing will allow consumers to go to a single consolidated website to view and pay their bills. AT&T one of the nation's largest companies with over 90 million customers, is piloting this approach with a planned 1999 introduction. "
Doc1269,intuit ,1998," The Internet is changing finance dramatically, and entrepreneurial teams at Intuit are leading the way. Let me spend a moment discussing the management team that will drive those changes. "
Doc1270,intuit ,1998," On August 1, 1998, Bill Harris took over as lntuit??s President and Chief Executive Officer, as Bill Campbell assumed the responsibilities of Chairman. Bill Harris joined intuit in 1993 with the acquisition of ChipSoft, Inc., where he had served as President and CEO. During his tenure, ChipSoft??s revenue tripled and its market valuation grew tenfold. "
Doc1271,intuit ,1998," Bill Campbell, now Chairman, joined intuit in 1994 as President and CEO and built the strong management team we have in place today. Bill led intuit through major strategy changes as well as the development of a systems and financial infrastructure. We will continue to benefit from his ongoing insight. "
Doc1272,intuit ,1998," in my new position as Chairman of the Executive Committee, l will continue the same full-time, daily involvement with the direction and strategy of intuit, in the same role l have enjoyed since moving out of the CEO role in I994. l work closely with Bill and Bill as we execute our business strategy. "
Doc1273,intuit ,1998," in concluding, the future is happening at intuit. And the enthusiasm is spreading. You can feel it everywhere you go - from the passenger next to you on the airplane to your neighbor at the weekend Bar-B-Que. Intuit products help people manage the critical pieces of their financial lives, real problems that need real solutions. We are building that future every day, extending the excitement and exceeding expectations. "
Doc1274,intuit ,1999,"Two years ago, Intuit launched Quicken.com and embarked on a strategy to use the power of the Internet to revolutionize people??s financial lives. Since then, we have been defining a new world of connected finance using both the PC and the Internet to deliver this revolution. "
Doc1275,intuit ,1999," Today, Intuit is leading electronic finance thanks to the strong endorsement of our customers and the hard work of our employees. Our products and services enable people to connect to a wide range of financial resources and destinations from banks and insurance companies to lenders, investment firms and tax agencies. At the same time, we are creating links between these destinations, with the ultimate goal of completely interconnecting and simplifying all aspects of a person??s financial life. "
Doc1276,intuit ,1999," Fiscal 1999 was a terrific year for Intuit. We saw our Internet efforts take off while at the same time we had continued strength in our traditional desktop software businesses. We reported revenue of $847.6 million in fiscal 1999, including revenues from Lacerte, the professional tax software company we acquired in June 1998 and CRI, the payroll processing company we acquired in May 1999. This was an increase of 43% from fiscal 1998 revenue, which did not include CRI and Lacerte. Even more important, our internal revenue growth rate, excluding the effect of acquisitions, more than doubled ?? rising to 27%. "
Doc1277,intuit ,1999," Net income, on a pro forma basis, was up 90%, to $88.9 million or $1.39 per share. The many infrastructure improvements the Company put in place over the past year contributed to the growth in pro forma profitability. For example, we have increasingly used the Internet to improve the efficiency of our direct distribution channel. In fiscal 1999, the amount of products ordered or distributed over the Internet tripled, and we now do approximately 6% of our business this way. Pro forma financial information excludes gain on disposal of business, non-recurring marketing charges, acquisition-related charges, and gains related to the sale of marketable securities. On a GAAP basis, net income increased from a loss of $12.2 million to a profit of $376.5 million, which included $579.2 million, in pre-tax gains related to sales of marketable securities. "
Doc1278,intuit ,1999," Driving these powerful financial results was strong demand for QuickBooks, which helped grow small business division revenue by 40%. Our personal tax products, including TurboTax and WebTurboTax, had a banner year with revenue growth of 36%. Intuit??s Internet-based revenue increased 157% on a year-overyear basis and while not yet contributing to overall profitability it now represents $125.3 million in revenue. "
Doc1279,intuit ,1999," We are also driving an increase in revenue per customer, much of it repeat in nature, as we expand our e-finance solutions. For example, a small business customer may purchase QuickBooks once every three years, producing approximately $60 in annualized revenue. With the November 1998 launch of QuickBooks Online Payroll, that same customer can now sign up for our payroll service, representing more than $500 in additional potential revenue each year. "
Doc1280,intuit ,1999," During fiscal 1999, we saw our Internet businesses ramp. Quicken.com monthly page views increased 78% year-over-year, reaching 160 million in July 1999. Along with this tremendous growth in traffic, advertising revenue more than doubled to $29 million. Our QuickenMortgage online mortgage service originated closed loans exceeding $1.2 billion, although the business has not yet generated profits or significant revenue. Plus, we launched two Web-based products online payroll service for small businesses and WebTurboTax for individual taxpayers. The two-fold increase in the number of tax returns filed electronically and the ten-fold increase in WebTurboTax returns demonstrated the growing popularity of Intuit??s Internet-based tax products. "
Doc1281,intuit ,1999," Fiscal 1999 was also a good year for our core desktop software businesses. Quicken grew its installed base to 11 million users, and now has more than 1 million online banking customers. Benefiting from the January 1999 introduction of QuickBooks 99, sales for QuickBooks grew 47%, with the installed base rising to 2.7 million users. Intuit??s tax products also experienced a record year. We sold more than 4.4 million units of TurboTax in fiscal 1999, a 27% increase over the previous year, and revenues for our personal tax business increased 36%. In the professional tax area, our ProSeries and Lacerte products finished the tax year with a customer renewal rate over 92%. This high level of customer loyalty creates a very valuable base of reliable, recurring revenue and healthy profits. "
Doc1282,intuit ,1999," Over the course of history, technology innovations have created fundamental changes in people??s lives and in society as a whole. And, in the process, they have created enormous opportunities for companies to create value for customers and investors alike. The development of the internal combustion engine not only created the automobile industry, it spurred development and growth in such related industries as oil, steel making, construction, and travel and leisure. The semi-conductor similarly revolutionized our society, giving birth to a wide range of innovations from computers to consumer electronics. "
Doc1283,intuit ,1999," Today??s technology innovation is the Internet, and nowhere is the potential for change more profound than in financial services. Because financial transactions essentially consist of electronic pieces of data   bits and bytes   the Internet is ideally suited to deliver anytime anywhere connectivity. "
Doc1284,intuit ,1999," Our fundamental strategy unites the PC and the Internet to connect consumers and small business owners with a whole host of financial products and services to revolutionize how people do financial work. More important, Intuit is developing links between the various destinations to create interconnected financial solutions that will not only take the user to discrete destinations but also link one destination to another. "
Doc1285,intuit ,1999, It is this interconnection that makes e-finance so compelling. It??s what will truly change how people manage their everyday finances as well as major financial events and decisions. 
Doc1286,intuit ,1999, Following are some of the ways that connections and interconnections are delivering tangible benefits to Intuit customers. 
Doc1287,intuit ,1999," Intuit made significant strides in simplifying finance for small business owners. Our ultimate goal is simple: to create a seamless connected system that links small business owners to their financial institutions, accountants, tax authorities, suppliers, customers and employees, so that financial information can be automatically shared and updated. The result is that small business owners will be able to spend more time focusing on building their businesses and less on managing the tremendous volume of data and paper and accounting transactions. "
Doc1288,intuit ,1999," The market for payroll processing is huge, and payroll processing is a business, that is ideally suited for re-invention using the Internet and Intuit??s e-finance solutions. The introduction of our QuickBooks Online Payroll Service business in November 1998 was an important step in deploying e-finance to simplify small business owners?? lives. The service is designed to take the hassle out of payroll management, tax filings, W2 processing, payroll data back-up and direct deposits for our QuickBooks customers. Because our Web-based payroll is integrated into QuickBooks, business owners no longer have to re-enter the payroll data that??s already in their accounting system. They also enjoy greater flexibility than with traditional payroll companies and save significantly on payroll costs. Equally important, Web-based payroll helps business owners track state and federal payroll tax changes and more accurately compute their tax liability, which significantly reduces the chance of errors and resulting IRS penalties. "
Doc1289,intuit ,1999," Since the launch of QuickBooks Online Payroll in November 1998, we have signed up approximately 6,000 businesses and processed over $250 million in payrolls. "
Doc1290,intuit ,1999," Our acquisition of Computing Resources, Inc., the Reno, Nevada-based payroll services provider, was key in executing on our small business strategy during fiscal 1999. With CRI, we have gained an established platform for delivering our current payroll services and expanding the suite of products we offer in the future. We are delighted to have the employees of CRI as part of the Intuit team. "
Doc1291,intuit ,1999," As we go forward, Intuit will be integrating multiple Web-based services into QuickBooks, interconnecting small business owners in more ways with customers, suppliers and the government. "
Doc1292,intuit ,1999," Intuit??s vision for the personal tax business also is simple. We are working toward the day when it takes a taxpayer just two minutes to electronically retrieve all of their relevant financial and past tax data, automatically load the data into tax preparation software and then automatically prepare and file their tax returns with federal and state tax agencies. "
Doc1293,intuit ,1999," In fiscal 1999, we continued to make strides in reaching this vision. Intuit is now recognized by the IRS as an official agent for receipt of electronic tax returns, which means that a return e-filed with Intuit is officially postmarked when received by an Intuit server. In addition, Intuit was approved for participation in an electronic signature program, eliminating the need to send a separate piece of paper to the IRS when filing tax returns electronically. Fiscal 1999 brought explosive growth in our Web-based personal tax preparation and electronic filing business. We saw a ten-fold increase in the volume of our WebTurboTax business, with more than 240,000 federal tax returns and 148,000 state tax returns filed. The opportunity for continued volume growth is enormous, with more than 43 million taxpayers who manually prepare their income taxes. "
Doc1294,intuit ,1999," We??re especially happy to see lower income individuals take advantage of the Internet and jump the ??digital divide.?? Through our Quicken Tax Freedom program, we donated WebTurboTax preparation and filing at no charge for taxpayers with adjusted annual incomes of $20,000 or less. Last year, more than 100,000 federal and state tax returns were prepared and filed through this program. We plan to expand this program even further for tax year 1999, donating online preparation and electronic filing to all taxpayers using the 1040EZ form, regardless of their annual income. "
Doc1295,intuit ,1999," Using the Internet to streamline the preparation and filing component of taxes is only part of our vision. We are actively working with the organizations that provide individuals with tax data   bank and lenders, investment brokers and managers, employers   to develop the interconnections that can revolutionize the front-end data-gathering component. "
Doc1296,intuit ,1999," Intuit continues to revolutionize the lives of individual consumers by connecting and interconnecting their financial information. During the past fiscal year, more and more Intuit customers enjoyed the convenience and flexibility of e-finance, from banking online with Quicken to comparing and applying for mortgages on QuickenMortgage. "
Doc1297,intuit ,1999," Through QuickenMortgage, consumers throughout the United States can now access home equity loans and sub-prime mortgages as well as obtain online pre-approval letters. Intuit has invested aggressively in software technology linking consumers to mortgage lenders over the Internet. As a result, QuickenMortgage is unique in providing mortgage quotes tailored to each borrower, so those consumers see only those loans for which they qualify. "
Doc1298,intuit ,1999," Our Quicken InsureMarket website on Quicken.com continues to ramp both its life and auto insurance offerings. Although this business has not yet generated profits or significant revenue, life insurance policy applications per month grew 66% during fiscal year 1999. And, more than 70% of the US driving population can obtain multiple online auto insurance quotes on Quicken InsureMarket. Our vision for the future includes completely interconnecting consumers?? financial data. For example, Web tax return information can feed mortgage applications, which produces homeowners?? insurance applications, which gathers price quotes from moving companies. In short, the financial information, products and services that people want and need   anytime, anywhere, in less time and for less money. "
Doc1299,intuit ,1999," Intuit enters fiscal 2000 with a solid strategy, a valuable base of loyal customers, great people and great products, and a strong balance sheet. The foundation for our continued growth is impressive: We enter fiscal 2000 with 15 million customers who use our products, many of whom have been loyal Intuit customers for more than a decade. We have retained compelling market leadership with our three flagship brands   Quicken, QuickBooks and Turbo Tax. At the same time, we are transforming finance on the Internet and are emerging as the e-finance leader. We have grown the total earning power of our core businesses with pro-forma operating profits double the prior year. "
Doc1300,intuit ,1999," As well as we are doing in our e-finance efforts, we must do even more. We need to step up employee hiring and retention. We need to manage the appropriate balance between short-term profits and long-term investments in our high-growth Internet businesses. Above all, as we get larger, we need to maintain the speed and agility to move quickly and decisively. "
Doc1301,intuit ,1999," We are delighted with the growth Intuit achieved this year   particularly on the Internet. And, we want to make fiscal 2000 the year we unmistakably establish Intuit as the leader in electronic finance. "
Doc1302,intuit ,2000,"When Intuit sold its first box of Quicken software in 1983, our mission was simple: to revolutionize how people manage their financial lives. That mission hasn??t changed and the revolutions we??ve created for millions of individuals and small business owners have grown and become more exciting every year. With the emergence of new ideas and technologies, the revolution is accelerating. "
Doc1303,intuit ,2000," Intuit completed its first fiscal year of the 21st century, hitting key corporate financial milestones and setting the stage for stronger growth in fiscal 2001. "
Doc1304,intuit ,2000," We topped a billion dollars in revenue for the first time, with fiscal 2000 revenue up 16 percent over fiscal 1999 to $1.1 billion. "
Doc1305,intuit ,2000," On a GAAP basis, Intuit had net income of $305.7 million, which included $481.1 million in pre-tax gains from the sale of marketable securities and other investments. "
Doc1306,intuit ,2000," Our pro forma net income was $134.2 million, up 35 percent from the $99.6 million Intuit reported in fiscal 1999.* "
Doc1307,intuit ,2000," Pro forma earnings per share were $0.64, up 28 percent from $0.50 per share from fiscal 1999. "
Doc1308,intuit ,2000," We continued to strengthen our balance sheet. As of July 31, 2000, Intuit had $2.1 billion in stockholder??s equity with almost $1.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. "
Doc1309,intuit ,2000," Our Internet businesses delivered $294 million in revenue, up 108 percent from last year; three of our eight Internet businesses achieved profitability. "
Doc1310,intuit ,2000," QuickBooks added nearly 500,000 new users nearly one every minute to reach 2.9 million registered users. Our retail unit share for small business accounting software was more than 85 percent for fiscal 2000. "
Doc1311,intuit ,2000," QuickBooks revenue reached record levels, despite distributing more than 350,000 free units for Year 2000 compliance. "
Doc1312,intuit ,2000," Quicken software achieved record revenue, units and profitability. "
Doc1313,intuit ,2000," Quicken software added two million new users, bringing the total of active Quicken households to an all-time high of 14 million. "
Doc1314,intuit ,2000," Consumer tax products produced record revenue, units and profits despite increasing competition and aggressive marketing and pricing programs. "
Doc1315,intuit ,2000," Quicken TurboTax for the Web crossed the one million user mark, growing 470 percent to 1.4 million users and revenue more than doubled. Our 80 percent unit share in the Web tax channel is even greater than in the desktop retail channel. "
Doc1316,intuit ,2000, Quicken TurboTax desktop customers increased 18 percent to nearly five million users. 
Doc1317,intuit ,2000," The customer base for our online payroll business more than tripled to almost 13,700 users. Online payroll revenue increased 245 percent from the prior year. "
Doc1318,intuit ,2000," From the very beginning, our strategy has been clear: take complex customer problems and develop solutions that make things simple. Our goal is to create changes so profound that people can??t imagine going back to the old way. "
Doc1319,intuit ,2000, Here are some of the key initiatives that contributed to our success in fiscal 2000 and will continue to serve as the foundation for accelerated growth in fiscal 2001 and beyond. 
Doc1320,intuit ,2000," This is one of Intuit??s historical strengths delivering innovative solutions, building upon the knowledge of our customers and honoring our commitment to provide them with valuable products and services. Here are some key examples of how we applied this innovative spirit in fiscal 2000. "
Doc1321,intuit ,2000," QuickBooks Internet Gateway This innovative offering, built on QuickBooks 2000, provides small business owners with easy access to e-services ranging from online credit card approval to business insurance and postage all from within their accounting software. The QuickBooks Internet Gateway is still early in its deployment and as the business ramps, we believe this is a great growth opportunity. "
Doc1322,intuit ,2000," QuickBooks Site Builder Intuit revolutionized the process for creating and maintaining a Web site with its QuickBooks Site Builder solution, available with QuickBooks 2000 and, beginning in August 2000, as a stand-alone version. Using this breakthrough software, small business owners can select a domain name and set up a highly professional Web site with five simple steps in less than 10 minutes almost immediately extending their reach to a global audience. "
Doc1323,intuit ,2000," Online Bill Management Intuit is setting the standard for online bill management, offering the only service that lets customers view and direct payment for all their bills online. We completed our acquisition of the company that created this innovative software, Venture Finance Software Corp., in August. We believe there is significant opportunity in online bill management, although the timing for widespread consumer and biller adoption may still be years away. "
Doc1324,intuit ,2000," Consumer Tax In this highly competitive and dynamic market, Intuit remains the leader in innovation. Our online tax expertise will be essential as we roll out our vision of the 10-minute tax return, a process so simple that everything from getting a W-2 to filing a return can be completed electronically with virtually no paperwork. "
Doc1325,intuit ,2000, Innovation is the legacy that has enabled us to achieve leadership in our products and services. This historical strength continues to be a cornerstone of our strategy as we go forward. 
Doc1326,intuit ,2000," Operational rigor is also a key part of our strategy as it drives both a great customer experience and improved profitability. Customers have always been at the heart of everything we do at Intuit. As we evolve our business model to include more services, we need to ensure we keep our eye on the ever-changing dynamics of delivering great customer experiences. "
Doc1327,intuit ,2000," For an experience to be great, customers must feel their overall relationship with Intuit exceeds their expectations. This includes the use of our products and services, our fulfillment processes as well as all interactions with our company including our people and Web sites. Success in delivering great customer experiences will be demonstrated by continued customer loyalty and satisfaction and increased revenue per customer. "
Doc1328,intuit ,2000," By applying operational rigor throughout the entire organization we will also be able to realize margin improvements. We can drive down costs at the same time we deliver better customer experiences. In fiscal 2000, we realized some improvements in operating efficiency by consolidating facilities in our Mortgage, Payroll, and Financial Supplies businesses. We began a multi-year planning process to enable greater visibility into future investment and resource deployment decisions. We hired a new vice president dedicated to process excellence and are implementing Six Sigma quality pilot programs in selected parts of the company. In addition, we created a new position, vice president of procurement, to ensure we leverage our buying power and get the best deals possible. While we made some progress in fiscal 2000, the bulk of the benefits from our focus on operational rigor will come in fiscal 2001 and beyond. "
Doc1329,intuit ,2000," To do great things requires great people, and they are a key element of our strategy for success. Having joined Intuit within the past year, I know what brings people here. We have an incredibly talented team of people people who challenge themselves and their colleagues to push our products and services to the next level. But I??m convinced we can do even better, and I am raising the bar to create an environment that inspires, supports and rewards the best possible performance. We need to ensure that we are developing the talent we have and are bringing in new talent that can help us become a multi-billion dollar company. "
Doc1330,intuit ,2000," For Intuit to be the best that it can be, we must make sure we have a sustainable competitive advantage in each of our businesses. This advantage will be based, in part, on characteristics that distinguish us from the competition and that will establish Intuit as the preferred provider of services. In most of our businesses, we believe we already have a sustainable competitive advantage. In those where we don??t, we??re working hard to achieve it. A sustainable competitive advantage is critical in all of our businesses, because we believe it will drive growing profitability in the near term while providing more funds for reinvestment and growth in the future. "
Doc1331,intuit ,2000," The end game is simple: we expect to drive stronger growth in both our revenues and profitability. We??ve challenged our business leaders to deliver revenue growth of 22 percent for fiscal 2001, up from 16 percent in fiscal 2000, and pro forma operating income growth in the low 30 percent range, up from 13 percent in fiscal 2000. "
Doc1332,intuit ,2000," Intuit enters the second year of the new century with incredible strengths in our people, our products and the more than 22 million customers who turn to us for smart, easy solutions to their financial needs. We also have a strong balance sheet and a business plan that is focused on delivering even more value to all our stakeholders customers, employees and investors. "
Doc1333,intuit ,2000," I??m proud of the results that Intuit delivered in fiscal 2000. But I??m even more excited about the opportunity to sharpen our focus, accelerate our performance and innovate new solutions in the coming year. I??m excited about the revolutions that lie ahead. "
Doc1334,intuit ,2001,"Intuit delivered strong results in fiscal 2001. We increased revenue 15 percent and grew pro forma operating income 42 percent-significantly better than the target we set a year ago. By growing revenue much faster than expenses, we improved our pro forma operating margin 3.3 points to 17.4 percent. "
Doc1335,intuit ,2001," Why did Intuit have such strong results when so many other companies struggled? The answer is simple. We have strong positions in good businesses that aren't significantly impacted by the recent turbulence in the economy. At the same time, we're running the Company better than ever before. We're 18 months into the execution of a multi-year game plan to make Intuit the best company it can be. "
Doc1336,intuit ,2001," I'm pleased with our fiscal 2001 results, especially given the external challenges. I'm also bullish about Intuit's future for several key reasons: "
Doc1337,intuit ,2001," We're developing stronger positions in tax and small business, areas where Intuit has strong leadership positions and where there's significant opportunity for additional profitable growth. "
Doc1338,intuit ,2001," We made nice progress in our pro forma operating margin in fiscal 2001, but still have a lot of room for improvement to reach parity with best-in-class companies. "
Doc1339,intuit ,2001," We're also making the transition from being primarily a desktop software company to becoming a provider of both software and services. Our payroll services, TurboTax for the Web and Quicken Loans all had significant growth in the past year. "
Doc1340,intuit ,2001," In a year that was difficult for many companies, Intuit posted strong results: On a pro forma basis, Intuit reported net income of $184.1 million for the year, or $0.86 per share, up 37 percent and 34 percent respectively, from fiscal 2000. Because pro forma results focus on the core earning power of the business, we believe they provide a meaningful view of our ongoing performance. This is true regardless of whether pro forma results are better or worse than GAAP results. For example, we didn't include gains on the sale of marketable securities of $481.1 million in our pro forma results for fiscal 2000. "
Doc1341,intuit ,2001," Intuit has presented pro forma results using consistent standards quarter-overquarter and year-over-year for more than five years. We always exclude both the gains and losses related to marketable securities and other investments and always exclude the gains and losses related to discontinued businesses. We also exclude acquisition-related charges, reorganization costs and similar items. "
Doc1342,intuit ,2001, Intuit's pro forma operating margin was up 3.3 points to 17.4 percent. 
Doc1343,intuit ,2001, Revenue of $1.26 billion increased 15 percent over fiscal 2000. 
Doc1344,intuit ,2001," On a GAAP basis, Intuit had a net loss of $82.8 million, or a loss of $0.40 per share. Results were impacted by pre-tax charges. The charges included $98.1 million, or $0.28 in after-tax earnings per share, in combined write-downs and losses related to marketable securities and other investments. Also there was an additional $95.4 million, or $0.44 in after-tax earnings per share, in acquisition related costs in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000, due primarily to the accelerated write-down of goodwill for prior acquisitions. "
Doc1345,intuit ,2001," Intuit continues to have a strong balance sheet, with nearly $1.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, or approximately $7.25 per share, at the end of fiscal 2001. "
Doc1346,intuit ,2001," Intuit has a diverse portfolio of businesses, with different revenue drivers and growth rates. Although some of the businesses may exceed or fall short of expectations in any given year, the diversity of the portfolio better enables us to pull multiple levers to meet our targets. "
Doc1347,intuit ,2001," In fiscal 2001, three of our businesses-payroll, consumer tax and Quicken Loans had exceptional performance: "
Doc1348,intuit ,2001," Intuit's payroll business posted great results, with revenue of $118.1 million, up 57 percent from fiscal 2000. The payroll business added approximately 80,000 customers across its product line, up 13 percent. The business had a significant profit turnaround. "
Doc1349,intuit ,2001," Intuit had a record season in its consumer tax business. Revenue was up 26 percent over fiscal 2000 and the customer base grew 21 percent. Intuit added 1 million new Quicken TurboTax for the Web users, up 71 percent, and grew share of both units and revenue at retail for its Quicken TurboTax desktop product, according to NDP Intelect. "
Doc1350,intuit ,2001," Quicken Loans also had very strong growth, with revenue of $113.1 million, double the prior year. Quicken Loans had a 76 percent increase in the number of closed loans. The business also had strong profitability with a pro forma operating margin of more than 25 percent. "
Doc1351,intuit ,2001," While three of our businesses had great years, two businesses, our QuickBooks-related businesses and Quicken.com, performed below expectations. Our remaining businesses were in line with our 2001 expectations. "
Doc1352,intuit ,2001," Intuit's objective is to win big in every business we're in-to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage we can monetize. Being in good businesses is critical to being the best we can be, and we made a number of moves in fiscal 2001 to strengthen our portfolio. We made some tough calls, exiting our online insurance and Web-based bill management businesses. At the same time, we strengthened our portfolio by acquiring a professional tax software business and a human resources-related services firm. "
Doc1353,intuit ,2001," With our strong portfolio of businesses, Intuit is executing a two-pronged growth strategy, pulling the key revenue and profit levers: "
Doc1354,intuit ,2001, Intuit is executing on a number of fronts to drive revenue growth: - We're broadening the definition of the markets we serve; - We're continuing to innovate and launch new products and services that help our customers be more successful; We're maintaining a high level of investment in opportunities that will drive future growth; - We're making key acquisitions and alliances; and - We're pricing our products to reflect the increasing value they provide customers. 
Doc1355,intuit ,2001," At the same time, we've been driving margin improvement through operational rigor. Bottom line, we're running a much tighter ship than in the past: We have more disciplined management and execution; We're much more selective in how we allocate resources; We've implemented Six Sigma process excellence programs to deliver better service to our customers at lower costs; and We've dramatically improved our procurement processes. "
Doc1356,intuit ,2001," The best news is that we haven't yet seen the full operational and financial benefits of these new initiatives. Intuit made great progress at improving pro forma operating margins in fiscal 2001-up 3.3 points to 17.4 percent. But I think there's significant room for improvement, especially when you compare our margins with those of the companies we benchmark ourselves against-software and service companies with leading market positions. "
Doc1357,intuit ,2001," For example, Adobe has an operating margin of about 33 percent, Paychex has a margin of about 36 percent, and Microsoft is at about 48 percent, when you adjust their most recent fiscal year performance to be comparable with Intuit's pro forma accounting. I look at the large gap between Intuit and these companies and see tremendous opportunity. "
Doc1358,intuit ,2001," Since I joined Intuit in January 2000, I've been talking to investors and employees about how the Company is moving more and more to becoming a tax and small business company. Let's first look at a broader view of tax at Intuit. "
Doc1359,intuit ,2001," Intuit's tax-related businesses are key to the Company's continued growth and profitability. That's because even in difficult economic times, people still have to pay taxes. In addition, our tax businesses grow because taxes keep getting more complex, which makes our tax solutions even more valuable. "
Doc1360,intuit ,2001," Intuit's tax-related businesses are larger and broader than most people realize. These businesses comprised almost half of Intuit's total revenue in fiscal 2001. They include our consumer and professional tax businesses, which help individuals and accountants prepare income taxes, and also our payroll products and services and our tax supplies and forms business. "
Doc1361,intuit ,2001," Intuit's tax businesses are an engine of our profitable growth. They generate strong growth, profits and reliable recurring revenue: "
Doc1362,intuit ,2001," Tax is growing. In fiscal 2001, revenue from tax-related businesses grew 25 percent over the prior year. There is opportunity for much growth ahead as the multi-year phase-ins of President Bush's tax changes guarantee more tax complexity for many years ahead. "
Doc1363,intuit ,2001," Tax is profitable. Taken as a whole, our tax-related businesses generated better than a 30 percent pro forma operating profit margin in fiscal 2001. "
Doc1364,intuit ,2001," Tax is recurring. Payroll happens every pay period. People prepare their taxes every year. Customers re-order tax supplies and forms. And once customers start with an Intuit solution, they are very loyal, which creates a recurring revenue stream. "
Doc1365,intuit ,2001, Our tax businesses are one of the key reasons Intuit continues to deliver in the current economic environment. 
Doc1366,intuit ,2001," Now I'd like to focus on small business. In September 2001, we announced our strategy for driving growth and positioning Intuit to better address the $17 billion small business management opportunity. Our strategy is called Right For My Business, and is comprised of three elements. First, we will provide solutions that are industry-specific. Second, we will provide accounting solutions for companies that are bigger or that have more complex needs. Third, we will provide additional solutions that go beyond accounting to meet business management needs. "
Doc1367,intuit ,2001, Intuit will take three approaches to delivering industry-specific solutions that are Right For My Business: 
Doc1368,intuit ,2001," We'll launch new flavors of QuickBooks-versions that provide integrated solutions targeted at the specific needs of different industries. In fiscal 2002, we will launch versions tailored to both retailers and accountants. "
Doc1369,intuit ,2001," We'll deliver solutions through the Intuit Developer Network. Through a beta program, more than 25 third-party developers have created applications that will launch concurrent with QuickBooks 2002 in December 2001, including legal time tracking and bookseller inventory. We expect the number of applications available through the Intuit Developer Network to grow significantly in coming years. "
Doc1370,intuit ,2001," We'll acquire companies that provide vertical business management solutions for specific industries. In early fiscal 2002, we announced our acquisition of OMware, Inc., which provides standalone business management solutions for construction companies. "
Doc1371,intuit ,2001," As I mentioned earlier, Intuit will also deliver expanded accounting solutions for bigger or more complex companies: "
Doc1372,intuit ,2001," In December 2001, we will launch QuickBooks Premier, which has general ledger enhancements, including a streamlined process for reversing journal entries, for companies with more complex needs. "
Doc1373,intuit ,2001," Around the end of fiscal 2002, we plan to offer a new product targeted at companies with up to 250 employees. "
Doc1374,intuit ,2001," Small business owners also have a range of business management headaches that go beyond accounting. The third element of Intuit's Right For My Business strategy is targeted at solving those problems, much as we have done with our payroll and supplies businesses. We've announced two solutions that go beyond accounting "
Doc1375,intuit ,2001, We'll be offering a QuickBooks retirement solution to provide small business owners with a variety of retirement plan options. 
Doc1376,intuit ,2001," We're also developing a QuickBooks human resource management tool, which is expected in the summer of 2002. "
Doc1377,intuit ,2001," I'm very excited about our Right For My Business small business strategy. We start from a unique position of strength-providing mission-critical accounting systems, which are the central nervous systems for small businesses. We have a strong and loyal base of about 2.5 million QuickBooks users. And we have a strategy that centers on providing the right solutions for each of those businesses-not a one-size-fits-all solution. "
Doc1378,intuit ,2001," I'm also excited about what this means for stockholders. Some of Intuit's most profitable services today share the characteristics of our new focus: add-on services, higher-end offerings and industry-specific solutions. With our strong assets and our Right For My Business strategy, Intuit intends to be the engine that powers America's small business success. "
Doc1379,intuit ,2001, Intuit has made a number of moves to position the organization for a stronger future: 
Doc1380,intuit ,2001," Since the beginning of 2000, we've significantly strengthened and deepened our management team, creating a number of new officer level positions to bring new expertise to the Company. We recently added a new senior vice president to head our entire small business organization, as well as a new chief information officer and chief technology officer. We've also added senior leaders to head our procurement and Six Sigma efforts. "
Doc1381,intuit ,2001," Along the same lines, we've strengthened our human resources leadership team and doubled our investment to make Intuit an even greater place to work. This is paying off in employee turnover that's lower than companies in comparable businesses during the past year. "
Doc1382,intuit ,2001," We've also taken a more disciplined, rigorous and analytical approach to running the Company, with much more emphasis on data-based decisions and processes to ensure discipline and focus in everything we do. "
Doc1383,intuit ,2001," Intuit had a great fiscal 2001, with 15 percent revenue growth and a 42 percent improvement in our pro forma operating income. We're proving our ability to execute our strategy for profitable growth. "
Doc1384,intuit ,2001," Great companies manage for both the short and long term. So while Intuit delivered strong results in fiscal 2001, we also positioned ourselves to deliver again in fiscal 2002 and beyond. I'm proud of what we've accomplished, but I believe the best is yet to come. "
Doc1385,intuit ,2002,"Intuit had another great year in fiscal 2002, delivering outstanding value for customers, employees and stronger financial results. Revenue was up 18 percent and pro forma operating income increased 50 percent.We??re continuing to execute our strategy to penetrate large, underserved market opportunities, deliver sustainable growth and drive Intuit to be the best we can be. "
Doc1386,intuit ,2002," We??re pleased with our performance over the past few years. In addition to continuing our tradition of successful, customer-driven innovation, Intuit is beginning to establish a solid track record of delivering stronger revenue and profit growth. There are three key fundamentals driving our success: "
Doc1387,intuit ,2002," We deliberately choose to be in businesses where we have, or we believe we can achieve, the strategic and durable advantage to produce long-term profitable growth "
Doc1388,intuit ,2002," Within these businesses we create new growth from pursuing large, underserved portions of the market as we continue to accelerate customer-driven innovation "
Doc1389,intuit ,2002," By applying strategic and operational rigor, we??re executing well so we capitalize on these multiple, large opportunities "
Doc1390,intuit ,2002," As an added benefit, our business models drive significant profit leverage. There are several dynamics at work "
Doc1391,intuit ,2002," Volume   Our businesses have significant fixed costs and low variable costs. As a result, selling more units means we drop significantly more profits to the bottom line "
Doc1392,intuit ,2002," Value   As we expand the functionality of our products and services, we deliver products with higher price points to reflect the greater value we deliver to customers "
Doc1393,intuit ,2002," Mix   We??re proving that as we move up-market with many of our product and service offerings, our customers are responding well, which drives mix improvement and more revenue and profits per customer "
Doc1394,intuit ,2002, This provides Intuit an excellent foundation for continued strong growth in fiscal 2003 and beyond.We??re convinced that the best is yet to come. 
Doc1395,intuit ,2002, Intuit posted outstanding results in fiscal 2002: 
Doc1396,intuit ,2002," On a GAAP basis, Intuit had net income of $140.2 million, or $0.64 per share, up from a loss of $82.8 million, or $0.40 per share. "
Doc1397,intuit ,2002," On a pro forma basis, Intuit reported operating income of $282.4 million for the year, up 50 percent from $188.9 million in fiscal 2001. "
Doc1398,intuit ,2002, Intuit??s pro forma operating margin of 20.8 percent was up 440 basis points from 16.4 percent in fiscal 2001. 
Doc1399,intuit ,2002, Revenue of $1.36 billion increased 18 percent from $1.15 billion in fiscal 2001. 
Doc1400,intuit ,2002," Intuit continues to have a strong balance sheet, with nearly $1.3 billion in cash and short-term investments, or approximately $5.75 per share, at the end of fiscal 2002. "
Doc1401,intuit ,2002, Intuit has multiple engines to drive revenue and profit growth. Our two largest growth engines QuickBooks?? and TurboTax??  had outstanding years. 
Doc1402,intuit ,2002," One of Intuit??s biggest growth engines is QuickBooks. Over the past year, we??ve transformed QuickBooks from a one-size-fits-all product to a ??Right for My Business?? approach. This new and dramatically expanded mindset opens up several under served markets and will create opportunity for years to come. "
Doc1403,intuit ,2002," QuickBooks revenue was $250.9 million, up 16 percent from fiscal 2001, driven by strong unit growth and a shift to higher-end products with higher price points. QuickBooks introduced four new editions in fiscal 2002   QuickBooks Accountants Edition, QuickBooks Point of Sale, QuickBooks Premier and QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions in addition to new versions of the Basic and Pro products "
Doc1404,intuit ,2002," QuickBooks 2002 units were up 26 percent over QuickBooks 2001 in the comparable period, with our new, higher-end products accounting for 5.5 percent of the unit and 12 percent of the revenue mix. "
Doc1405,intuit ,2002," The Intuit Developer Network had an outstanding first year, providing QuickBooks customers better solutions. It??s great for customers who now can get what they want third-party applications they use to share data with QuickBooks. It??s great for developers, enabling them to reach customers they might not be able to reach on their own. It??s also great for Intuit as we generate more unit sales of QuickBooks, both from upgraders and new users. More than 125 applications were introduced in fiscal 2002 as part of the Intuit Developer Network. "
Doc1406,intuit ,2002," Looking forward, you can expect us to introduce additional QuickBooks versions tailored to meet the needs of specific industries   we think there??s opportunity for anywhere between 5-15 QuickBooks ??flavors.??We??ll also continue to improve our accounting products as we continue to focus on businesses with up to 250 employees. "
Doc1407,intuit ,2002," A second significant growth opportunity is business offerings beyond accounting   products and services that are horizontal in nature and bought by many types of businesses. Examples include payroll, technical support, supplies and information technology asset and resource management software.We intend to continue to drive new growth beyond accounting through offerings we develop internally, through acquisitions and through partnerships. "
Doc1408,intuit ,2002," Most of our current offerings have been QuickBooks focused. However, we also have an opportunity to expand beyond the QuickBooks base and continue to grow this $335 million business, which had a revenue increase of 15 percent in fiscal 2002. "
Doc1409,intuit ,2002," There are multiple growth engines within our beyond accounting offerings. An important one is payroll.With only about 25 percent of the 7.5 million employers with fewer than 250 employees using an outsourced solution today, this is a large, under-penetrated opportunity for Intuit. Our acquisition of CBS Payroll in June 2002 strengthens our payroll offering, providing us a full-service outsourced solution.We also continue to see strong results from our QuickBooks-branded payroll products. Revenue of $108 million was up 39 percent and we added more than 75,000 new customers in fiscal 2002. "
Doc1410,intuit ,2002," With our strong and loyal QuickBooks base, we have significant opportunity to drive sustained strong growth with our payroll engine   from providing do-it-yourself tax tables all the way through a complete outsourced solution. That means as our customers grow, we can grow with them. "
Doc1411,intuit ,2002," A good example of making acquisitions to drive growth beyond accounting is our acquisition in fiscal 2003 of Blue Ocean Software, Inc., which is a leading provider of software solutions that help businesses manage their technology resources and assets, including PC inventory, incident tracking, knowledge base resolution tools, software delivery and asset tracking. This is another mission-critical task for companies once they have 20 or more PCs. Blue Ocean is the leader in this segment, with a great product at an attractive price point. As we add the QuickBooks brand and customer team to Blue Ocean??s strong foundation, we??ll have another platform to drive profitable growth. "
Doc1412,intuit ,2002," Another growth engine is vertical business management solutions   an engine that didn??t exist for Intuit at the beginning of fiscal 2002. This is another significant opportunity for us, and we??re just getting started. Vertical business management solutions represent more than $4.5 billion in annual sales. It??s a highly fragmented segment, has no clear leader, and is significantly under-penetrated. "
Doc1413,intuit ,2002," We??ve moved aggressively to capitalize on this opportunity, acquiring four companies in fiscal 2002. Our strategy is to buy leading companies, with solid customer bases and management teams that, when combined with Intuit??s assets, will turbo-charge growth. "
Doc1414,intuit ,2002," We acquired four companies that provide business management solutions for specific industries: OMware, Inc., which serves the construction management industry.  American Fundware, which focuses on public sector organizations.  Management Reports, Inc., which provides solutions for commercial and residential property management.  Eclipse, Inc., which serves wholesale distributors of durable goods. "
Doc1415,intuit ,2002," The early results from OMware, which we acquired last November, indicate we??re on the right track. OMware revenue was up about 35 percent in fiscal 2002, exiting the year with fourth-quarter growth of over 50 percent. "
Doc1416,intuit ,2002," We??re seeing positive early signs from the other recently closed vertical acquisitions. And we??ll continue to make additional acquisitions to expand this growth engine in fiscal 2003.We expect our portfolio of vertical businesses to include between five and ten companies, with a combined annual revenue growth rate of more than 30 percent. "
Doc1417,intuit ,2002," TurboTax is another of Intuit??s large growth engines. There are still 89 million taxpayers who don??t currently use an Intuit product   either TurboTax or one of our professional tax products   providing us with significant opportunity for future growth in the years ahead. We??re working on a multi-year strategy to convert an increasing number of these millions of taxpayers to TurboTax, which we??ll begin to roll out in the coming tax season. "
Doc1418,intuit ,2002," TurboTax had a great fiscal 2002, thanks to continued product and service innovation and expansion of our distribution channels: "
Doc1419,intuit ,2002," Consumer tax revenue of $351.1 million was up 29 percent in fiscal 2002, driven by 20 percent unit growth to reach 7.7 million units. "
Doc1420,intuit ,2002, Consumer tax operating income of $214.1 million was up 47 percent over fiscal 2001. 
Doc1421,intuit ,2002," Growth was particularly strong on the Web, with paid federal TurboTax units up 84 percent over fiscal 2001 to reach 2.2 million units. "
Doc1422,intuit ,2002," We successfully introduced a new high-end TurboTax product on both the desktop and Web, which represented about 10 percent of the federal unit and 12 percent of the revenue mix. "
Doc1423,intuit ,2002," We enhanced the Instant Data Entry feature of our Automated Tax Return, making it even easier for more people to do their taxes. TurboTax customers imported more than one million tax documents   wages, interest, dividends and stock, mortgage interest and mutual fund transactions   directly into their TurboTax return this year, more than triple the number of imports from last tax season. "
Doc1424,intuit ,2002," We added new retailers like Safeway and Vons in selected locations, enabling us to reach a broader customer base and grow the category. "
Doc1425,intuit ,2002," Intuit also had a great year in our professional tax business: Revenue of $225.7 million was up 20 percent over fiscal 2001, driven in large part by the addition of new customers from the acquisition of a professional tax company in April 2001. This expanded customer base will help us drive steady organic growth in the coming years. "
Doc1426,intuit ,2002, Professional tax operating income of $115.2 million was up 27 percent over fiscal 2001. 
Doc1427,intuit ,2002," As we talk to the thousands of accountants who use our professional tax products, we??re uncovering a lot of unmet needs we can serve. And we??re working to expand our offering to pursue this large, under-penetrated opportunity and drive new growth. "
Doc1428,intuit ,2002," Intuit??s Canada business also had a great year, driven by strong growth in small business and tax. Revenue of $44.6 million was up 29 percent from fiscal 2001. "
Doc1429,intuit ,2002," Intuit continued to adjust its business portfolio to focus on driving sustainable growth. We continue to make the tough decisions to exit businesses that don??t fit our strategy. In July 2002, we sold our Quicken Loans subsidiary.While Quicken Loans produced strong results for Intuit over the past two fiscal years, the business is subject to interest rate fluctuations, which means it didn??t meet our criteria of being in businesses with steady, reliable demand. "
Doc1430,intuit ,2002," We took several steps to improve the performance of our Quicken-related businesses. As we??ve discussed in the past, the personal finance software category is mature and we don??t see significant opportunity to grow our core Quicken software business. But we love the Quicken brand, products and our strong and loyal customer base. And we continue to drive growth by offering Quicken-related services, including credit card and bill payments services. Revenue from Quicken-related services of $36.5 million was up nearly 50 percent in fiscal 2002. "
Doc1431,intuit ,2002, We??ve taken several steps to improve the performance of our Quicken businesses: 
Doc1432,intuit ,2002," We just added a great new service   Quicken Brokerage powered by SiebertSM   to offer online and telephone-based brokerage services to Quicken and Quicken.com customers. For years, people have been using Quicken to manage their personal finances and make more confident investment decisions based on their complete financial picture. Now they can also execute their decisions, which delivers more value to customers and drives new growth for Intuit. "
Doc1433,intuit ,2002," In response to lower revenue expectations, we??ve aggressively reduced costs in our Quicken businesses   a total of approximately $45 million over the last two years. "
Doc1434,intuit ,2002," Because these actions dramatically improve our opportunity to accelerate revenue growth and improve profitability in Quicken in fiscal 2003 and beyond, we like where this business is today. "
Doc1435,intuit ,2002, Two of our smaller businesses   Premier payroll and Japan   under-performed in fiscal 2002.We continue to focus on improving their results. 
Doc1436,intuit ,2002," Premier payroll, which is a private label, back-end service marketed and sold by banks, had revenue of approximately $40 million. This represented less than 3 percent of Intuit??s total revenue and was roughly flat with fiscal 2001. Because we don??t control customer acquisition, we don??t like this business model. Although there??s not an easy, short-term fix, we??re actively working to improve our position.We won??t let this business adversely impact our long-term performance. "
Doc1437,intuit ,2002," Our Japanese business, which also represented about 3 percent of Intuit??s revenue, was down approximately 12 percent in fiscal 2002 due to weak market conditions. Our business actually gained share in fiscal 2002, and profits were up significantly as we discontinued the QuickBooks Japan product.We??re working on several alternatives to improve performance, but revenue growth appears to be a challenge in the short term. "
Doc1438,intuit ,2002," We continue to drive initiatives to make Intuit a great place to work, build a high-performance organization and be the employer of choice. "
Doc1439,intuit ,2002, Intuit??s employees   at all levels of the organization   are critical to our ability to consistently deliver great offerings to our customers and sustained performance improvements to investors. Our strategy to attract and retain the best employees is to make Intuit a great place to work. 
Doc1440,intuit ,2002," We continued to make solid progress in our employee-related initiatives in fiscal 2002, as evidenced by recent recognition from external surveys: "
Doc1441,intuit ,2002, We were selected as one of Fortune magazine??s ??100 Best Companies to Work For?? in April 2002   the first year we submitted an entry. 
Doc1442,intuit ,2002, The Globe and Mail ranked Intuit Canada number two on its list of top Canadian employers. 
Doc1443,intuit ,2002, Readers of The Free Lance-Star and visitors to Fredericksburg.com voted Intuit??s Fredericksburg contact center the ??Best Place to Work?? in their 2002 ??Simply the Best?? survey. 
Doc1444,intuit ,2002, Intuit Reno won top honors as Business of the Year at the inaugural luncheon of the Economic Development Authority of Western Nevada and ??Best Firm to Work For ?? honors from the Nevada Business Journal in June 2001. 
Doc1445,intuit ,2002," As Intuit enters our 20th year in fiscal 2003, we continue to have an unparalleled record of successful customer-driven innovation, using technology to take complex customer problems and develop solutions to make things easier. Our goal is to create changes so profound customers wouldn??t dream of going back to the old ways   whether that??s keeping their books or managing their payroll, doing their taxes or managing their personal finances. At Intuit, innovation is not about technology   it??s about making our customers?? lives better. "
Doc1446,intuit ,2002," But innovation alone isn??t enough. Over the past two years, we??ve challenged the conventional paradigm that a company is either innovative or disciplined.We??re proving we can be both. In fact, by applying strategic and operational rigor, we??ve been able to accelerate our customer-driven innovation. "
Doc1447,intuit ,2002," By being both disciplined and innovative, we continue to focus on improving execution and delivering more   tightening development cycles to introduce more products faster. In fiscal year 2002, for example, we introduced four brand new QuickBooks products with only a 10 percent increase in QuickBooks development cost. The new products, in turn, drive stronger unit and revenue growth, which is great for investors. Plus we have more satisfied customers because they can select from a broader range of offerings to best meet their needs. "
Doc1448,intuit ,2002," Innovation is still our heartbeat, but strategic and operational rigor is our brain. This is the formula that will enable us to sustain Intuit??s growth in 2003 and beyond. And we??re just getting started.With our assets and strategies to drive growth, we??ve set an internal annual goal to deliver 15-20 percent organic revenue growth. Because of the unit growth opportunities to sell higher-end products and services, our scalable business models, and management discipline and execution, we expect to deliver pro forma operating income and EPS growth that??s 1.5 to 2 times revenue growth. "
Doc1449,intuit ,2002," Fiscal 2002 was a great year for Intuit, in terms of revenue growth, profits and cash generation. This year, as in the past, we??ve been candid about our successes, about where we??re underperforming and what we??re doing to produce real and sustainable growth in the future. "
Doc1450,intuit ,2002," Integrity without compromise is Intuit??s #1 operating value   and it has been since our operating values were formalized in 1993. Bottom line, everyone at the company is accountable for living up to the highest standards of business conduct and ethics. I won??t tolerate anything less and neither will the rest of Intuit??s management team. Here??s a brief overview of some of the steps we??ve already taken to ensure integrity in everything we do. "
Doc1451,intuit ,2002," In addition to having a culture of integrity, Intuit has always had robust internal processes and strong corporate governance. That??s why both Greg Santora, our senior vice president and chief financial officer, and I had no reservations voluntarily certifying all previously filed SEC documents beginning with last year??s 10-K that was filed in October 2001. Certifying past filings wasn??t mandated, but we went above and beyond the requirements because we??re confident in how we run the business and the integrity of our numbers.We??ve also certified our fiscal 2002 10-K before the deadline. "
Doc1452,intuit ,2002, Strong corporate governance is not new to Intuit. Here??s a quick overview of our practices in a few key areas: 
Doc1453,intuit ,2002, Board independence   Intuit has an experienced and engaged board of directors. The majority of our board members are independent and all audit and compensation committee members are independent.We have an active and probing audit committee. And the audit committee meets formally in scheduled private sessions with our independent auditors eight times a year. 
Doc1454,intuit ,2002, Auditor independence   Intuit has taken a number of steps to ensure continued independence of our outside auditor. Our independent auditors report directly to the audit committee and we limit the use of our audit firm for non-audit services.We also have restrictions on hiring former employees of our audit firm. 
Doc1455,intuit ,2002," Good governance is about doing the right things for the company and stockholders. This has always been a priority at Intuit.With the rest of corporate America now focused on governance, we??ve been able to benchmark our practices against recently published external corporate governance standards. Our high percentile scores validated that we??ve been doing the right things, which means it??s essentially business as usual at Intuit. "
Doc1456,intuit ,2002, I??d also like to provide our perspective on how we manage employee stock programs. There are several things we??re doing to balance two important objectives   building a highperformance organization and minimizing stockholder dilution. 
Doc1457,intuit ,2002," We??ve reduced our annual grant rate from over 5 percent to under 3.5 percent of shares outstanding in fiscal year 2002. This is a significant reduction, but we??re still focused on rewarding the best performers at all levels of the company. "
Doc1458,intuit ,2002, The Intuit shares we repurchased under our repurchase program in fiscal 2002 more than offset the future dilution of those options when they??re exercised. 
Doc1459,intuit ,2002," We use stock options as a tool to motivate and reward our best talent at all levels and think that the broad distribution of options is an integral part of our success at driving stronger performance. In fact, on average over the last 4 years, more than 75 percent of our grants have gone to employees below the vice president level. "
Doc1460,intuit ,2002," In terms of expensing stock options, we??ve been listening carefully to the dialogue. This is a complicated issue, but our position is that we??re not going to voluntarily expense options. We??ve been providing information on an annual basis about how expensing them would impact our EPS. Starting with the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we??ll provide that information quarterly to give investors even greater visibility going forward. "
Doc1461,intuit ,2002," To sum up, it??s been a great year, thanks to everyone at Intuit for making it possible.We not only delivered another solid year, we strengthened the foundation for an even brighter future. We??re proud of what we??ve accomplished and believe the best is yet to come. "
Doc1462,intuit ,2003,"Intuit posted another year of strong growth in fiscal 2003. Once again, we??ve demonstrated our ability to execute a proven recipe to drive solid and sustainable growth.We??re making sustained progress against our objective to make Intuit the best it can be. "
Doc1463,intuit ,2003, 2003 Financial Highlights ?? Revenue of $1.65 billion increased 26 percent from fiscal 2002. 
Doc1464,intuit ,2003, GAAP earnings per share increased 155 percent year-over-year to $1.63 per diluted share. GAAP net income grew 145 percent to $343 million. 
Doc1465,intuit ,2003, Pro forma* EPS grew 51 percent year-over-year to $1.39. Pro forma* operating income increased 46 percent from fiscal 2002 to $400 million. 
Doc1466,intuit ,2003, Intuit??s pro forma* operating margin of 24.2 percent was up 340 basis points from 20.8 percent in fiscal 2002. 
Doc1467,intuit ,2003," Intuit repurchased nearly 18 million shares of its common stock under its stock repurchase program for more than $800 million. Since we introduced our first repurchase program in May 2001, we??ve repurchased more than 25.5 million shares for $1.1 billion. "
Doc1468,intuit ,2003," Intuit continues to have a strong and liquid balance sheet, with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments, or approximately $6 per share, at the end of fiscal 2003. "
Doc1469,intuit ,2003, Each of our Five Growth Engines Delivered Solid Results in the Year QuickBooks revenue grew 24 percent over fiscal 2002 to $242.8 million. 
Doc1470,intuit ,2003, Intuit??s Small Business Services revenue increased 35 percent over fiscal 2002 to $454.9 million. 
Doc1471,intuit ,2003, TurboTax revenue of $422.9 million was up 20 percent from fiscal 2002. 
Doc1472,intuit ,2003, Revenue from Intuit??s Professional Accounting Solutions business increased 8 percent over fiscal 2002 to $243.4 million. 
Doc1473,intuit ,2003," Intuit??s Vertical Business Management Solutions unit contributed $94.8 million in revenue, a 5 percent increase over the revenue those companies generated in fiscal 2002. "
Doc1474,intuit ,2003," Strengthening the Leadership Team While focused on driving profitable growth, we also took steps to strengthen and deepen our team. This is a constant process for Intuit we are continually assessing our organization to ensure we have the people we need to take us to the next level. "
Doc1475,intuit ,2003," In fiscal 2003, we made several organizational changes to drive growth within each of our growth engines and across Intuit as a whole. In June, we created the Office of the CEO to ensure we are driving strategic initiatives across the company. Scott Cook, Intuit??s founder and chairman of the executive committee, and Lorrie Norrington, executive vice president, join me on this team. Lorrie is taking the lead for Intuit??s small business related initiatives, the Intuit Developer Network and other corporate initiatives. Scott continues to focus on our customer-driven innovation and customer advocacy initiatives. I continue to manage all the business units and functions. "
Doc1476,intuit ,2003," At the same time, we added talent and promoted from within to continue building a highperformance organization. In the past 12 months, we??ve hired a new chief financial officer, a senior vice president in charge of legal and corporate affairs and a new chief marketing officer. In addition, we promoted senior managers to run our Verticals and QuickBooks growth engines. The result of these changes and others that have taken place throughout the company is a high-performance organization that can execute effectively on our growth recipe. "
Doc1477,intuit ,2003," 20 Years of Customer-Driven Innovation Intuit marked its 20th anniversary in 2003. And while many things have changed since the company was founded, some have not.We remain as passionate as ever about customer-driven innovation innovation that is customer-based not technology-focused.We dig deep to understand our customers and identify their needs and pain points. And then we challenge conventional wisdom to uncover new, innovative solutions to those pain points. "
Doc1478,intuit ,2003," A good example of Intuit??s customer-driven innovation is the development of QuickBooks in 1992. Before QuickBooks, conventional wisdom said that accounting software had to have double-entry accounting. But we knew small businesses had different needs. They didn??t want to learn accounting. . .they wanted a simple way to keep their books.We used that knowledge to create QuickBooks, the first single-entry accounting software. Customers quickly made it and continue to make it the best-selling small business accounting software. "
Doc1479,intuit ,2003," And it??s not just QuickBooks. Customer-driven innovation is our core competence it??s at the heart of our products, market leadership and success. "
Doc1480,intuit ,2003," Intuit??s Growth Recipe Over the past several years, Intuit has generated stronger results by consistently executing a proven growth recipe. That recipe includes four ingredients. "
Doc1481,intuit ,2003," First, Intuit has carefully chosen the businesses we??re in. We focus on businesses where we have a durable competitive advantage, and that have large, under-served opportunities. "
Doc1482,intuit ,2003," We??ve taken decisive action to re-shape our business portfolio in recent years, exiting businesses that don??t fit our screen and acquiring new growth platforms. In fiscal 2003 we made several moves.We acquired Blue Ocean Software, which provides software that enables small businesses to manage their technology resources. In February, we sold our Japanese subsidiary. "
Doc1483,intuit ,2003," The second ingredient of the recipe is getting the basics right applying operational rigor and process excellence methodology, tools and resources to execute more effectively on a daily basis. Our goal is higher service levels at lower cost, and we??re reaching that goal in many areas across the company. "
Doc1484,intuit ,2003," In QuickBooks technical support, for example, we launched an initiative to see how we could handle customer calls better and faster.We found it was taking too much time to diagnose the customer??s problem frustrating for customers and expensive for Intuit. By digging into the data, we identified the root cause and developed a step-by-step process to correct it. As a result, we??ve improved the customer satisfaction level and reduced overall handle times by one minute per rep with annual savings of over $1 million in just one of our contact centers. "
Doc1485,intuit ,2003," We??ve redesigned our supply chain to deliver better service at lower cost. By doing so, we??re achieving a 99 percent on-time retail delivery for QuickBooks, TurboTax, and Quicken products at launch, up significantly from prior years. By locating manufacturing, warehousing, and shipping operations in a single physical location, we??re reducing transit times and freight expenses.We also shortened the replenishment cycle by as much as five days and reduced our Cost of Goods Sold by up to 5 percent for these products. "
Doc1486,intuit ,2003," While day-to-day execution isn??t glamorous, it??s the lifeblood of a high-performing organization and a key ingredient in our growth recipe.We work hard to get better and better every day. "
Doc1487,intuit ,2003, The third ingredient is expanding customer-driven innovation. We continuously look to uncover additional customer problems to solve. . .or better ways to solve existing problems.We then challenge conventional wisdom and then create great new solutions for customers and profitable growth for Intuit. 
Doc1488,intuit ,2003, Our Right for My Business QuickBooks strategy is a good example of how customer-driven innovation is delivering more for customers and Intuit.We??ve accomplished a lot since we launched the first wave of new offerings in December 2001: 
Doc1489,intuit ,2003," Customers told us they were outgrowing QuickBooks, so we??ve launched two up-market QuickBooks versions QuickBooks Premier and QuickBooks Enterprise for larger and more complex small businesses. "
Doc1490,intuit ,2003," Customers told us they wanted QuickBooks that was designed for the unique needs of their specific industry, so we??ve launched five new industry-specific versions, or ??flavors?? of QuickBooks, with more to come. "
Doc1491,intuit ,2003," Customers told us they wanted us to help them solve needs beyond accounting, so we??ve introduced new horizontal add-on services like our QuickBooks Merchant Account Service and payroll services that integrate with QuickBooks. "
Doc1492,intuit ,2003," Customers told us they used other business management applications and that it would be great if they could share data seamlessly with QuickBooks. So we opened our historically closed, proprietary QuickBooks code base to outside developers, which has resulted in nearly 300 applications that are adding value to customers and helping developers. "
Doc1493,intuit ,2003," In fiscal 2001, before we began executing our Right for My Business strategy, we had QuickBooks revenue of $164 million and some believed this engine was out of gas. By executing our growth recipe, we??ve grown 48 percent to $243 million in just two years. As we look at this business today, we see plenty of additional opportunity to apply customer-driven innovation to make our customers lives better and drive profitable growth for Intuit. "
Doc1494,intuit ,2003," Equally important, this Right for My Business strategy has also driven tremendous growth in Small Business Services. In fiscal 2001, Small Business Services had revenue of $290 million.We??ve grown 57 percent since then to $455 million. Again, there is significant opportunity to deliver more for customers and Intuit. "
Doc1495,intuit ,2003, The fourth ingredient of our recipe is to apply strategic rigor to identify new adjacent markets and acquire companies that help us expand our leadership positions in our small business and tax businesses. Our goal is to create new growth platforms to drive faster profitable growth. 
Doc1496,intuit ,2003," We saw an attractive market opportunity for end-to-end business management solutions designed for specific industries. And we??ve made four acquisitions in the past two years to build a verticals growth engine.We??ve also expanded our Small Business Services offerings through our acquisitions of horizontal small business offerings from Blue Ocean Software and CBS Payroll. As we look into the future, we see many additional areas of interest and are working hard to uncover additional great companies we can acquire. "
Doc1497,intuit ,2003, Intuit has accomplished a lot since we began executing our growth recipe over the past three years. Revenue has grown 68 percent from $982 million in fiscal 2000 to $1.65 billion in fiscal 2003. 
Doc1498,intuit ,2003, Pro forma* operating income has more than doubled from $171 million to $400 million. 
Doc1499,intuit ,2003," Pro forma* operating margin has increased 680 basis points, from 17.4 percent to 24.2 percent. "
Doc1500,intuit ,2003, Pro forma* EPS has doubled from $0.69 to $1.39. 
Doc1501,intuit ,2003," Thanks to the talent and hard work of all Intuit employees, we??ve accomplished a lot in recent years. The durable power of this growth recipe is that if you have great assets and consistently execute on the ingredients, you continue to get better and generate improved results. "
Doc1502,intuit ,2003," But we aren??t resting on our laurels. As we enter our 21st year, we??re more committed than ever to making Intuit the best it can be.We??re pleased with the progress we??ve made, but believe the best is yet to come. "
Doc1503,microsoft ,1995,"in 1975, Paul Allen and I founded the first microcomputer software company Microsoft. Looking back over the last 20 years, our vision of a PC using great software as an empowering tool for everyone, coupled with our values of innovation, listening to customers, and taking a long-term approach in everything have been key to Microsoft's success. We have taken a number of risks over the years with products such as Microsoft Excel, Word, MSDOS, Windows, Windows NT, Macintosh applications, and CD-ROM software. Looking forward, we are pursuing the same vision with the same values. We will continue to take risks with future updates to our current products and with new products targeted to customers ranging from the enterprise user to the home user. "
Doc1504,microsoft ,1995," We are celebrating our 20th anniversary with the release of Microsoft Windows 95, the latest update to our popular Windows operating environment. More than just a technical achievement, Windows 95 and the related products, including Microsoft Office for Windows 95 and The Microsoft Network, represent a companywide accomplishment that required an extraordinary level of commitment and coordination challenging our marketing, manufacturing, sales, and support organizations. "
Doc1505,microsoft ,1995," The largest launch in the history of the PC business, Windows 95 also launches the personal computer in a new role as a platform for the Internet and the world of interactive networks. The continued advances in hardware and communications technology will allow PC software to change the way we work, learn, and play. The merging of computing and communications technologies will give our customers access to a wide range of information and multimedia services. We see more opportunities now for great software than at any time in our history. "
Doc1506,microsoft ,1995," With the help of our partners and the great work of our employees, we have come along way. This annual report offers a chance to review our recent accomplishments, as well as an opportunity to consider our future challenges. "
Doc1507,microsoft ,1996,We had a huge effect on the Internet. And it had a huge effect on us. 
Doc1508,microsoft ,1996," During Microsoft's 21-year history, the pace of innovation has been quite rapid. This past year stands out both for the exciting new products and the broad recognition that computers will revolutionize communications. Windows?? 95 was launched, and 40 million people were introduced to its benefits: ease of use, 32-bit applications, and increased productivity. Windows NT?? established phenomenal sales momentum and gained widespread acceptance as the foundation for the enterprise market and a new generation of corporate intranets and Web servers. "
Doc1509,microsoft ,1996," The Internet came of age, and Microsoft embraced the opportunity by enhancing its entire range of products and services to create the best Web experience for everyone from the casual Web surfer to the corporate IT manager. Microsoft is betting that over the next decade Internet use will grow dramatically. Next year research and development spending, broadly defined, will grow to more than $2 billion, at a growth rate faster than sales. Our R&D is driven by customer feedback and our belief that there are many breakthroughs in software that we can achieve by taking a long-term approach. "
Doc1510,microsoft ,1996," In our dialog with the financial community, we go out of our way to point out the challenges of maintaining or increasing our profitability. This conservatism is part of our culture. Despite this, we feel the prospects for our business over the next decade are very strong. "
Doc1511,microsoft ,1996," I want to thank our employees, customers, partners, and shareholders for all of their support in building Microsoft. "
Doc1512,microsoft ,1997,"1997 was an outstanding year. Our customers were asking for Microsoft to build products that allowed them to get business benefit out of the Internet, and we delivered. Across the board, with productivity applications, tools, desktop systems, and server products, we are gaining significant momentum. Like any time in our 23-year history we have great opportunities but face a number of threats. "
Doc1513,microsoft ,1997," Our top priority in fiscal 1998 is simplicity: reducing the total cost of ownership, and reducing complexity. We will need to keep this focus even as we roll out numerous products, and while competitors are battling with us on many fronts. "
Doc1514,microsoft ,1997," As we chart our path going forward, we are focused on four key areas: "
Doc1515,microsoft ,1997," Windows on the desktop. A few years ago, we developed the concept of Windows Everywhere, an architecture that allows customers to have a family of operating systems and a set of compatible applications spanning a family of devices from the very small to the very large. We??ve had great success moving computing desktops to 32-bit systems Microsoft?? Windows?? 95 and Windows NT?? Workstation as well as introducing Windows CE, a new version of the Windows operating system initially focused on handheld devices for mobile professionals. Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 will be another major step on our way to marrying the PC and the Internet. A core strength of Windows is its collection of development tools, allowing developers to tap into the richness of our platform and get great performance from their applications. "
Doc1516,microsoft ,1997," Productivity applications. Microsoft Office 97 was a major release, setting a new bar for features, functionality and integration. We put years of R&D into it and incorporated some of the discoveries coming out of our Research Division. Office 97 features natural language systems and sophisticated grammar checking. But that is just a start. Our goal is to allow people to get their work done in the easiest way possible, without thinking about the tools they??re using. "
Doc1517,microsoft ,1997," Enterprise solutions. Windows NT Server and the Microsoft BackOffice?? family line of server applications are growing at a phenomenal rate. As computer chips have become faster and faster, we have been able to deliver performance to customers previously accomplished only by mainframes. And beyond performance, we are now focused on simplicity and manageability. But there is still a lot more we intend to do to make high-end computing easier and less costly. "
Doc1518,microsoft ,1997," Interactive media and services. Our Interactive Media Group (IMG) has three areas of concentration: packaged software, hardware, and online services. All are about enhancing the consumer experience around the PC and Web lifestyle. Our packaged software efforts are focused on delivering great titles in the games, learning, personal finance and mapping categories. For hardware, our goal is to enhance the software experience. "
Doc1519,microsoft ,1997," In online services, the focus is on producing an exciting combination of software and content that will help customers tap the power of the Internet to lead more informed, more fun and more productive lives. Increasingly, you??ll see us emphasizing products and services where excellence in software makes the difference. Some of the investments we are making in this new area will pay off others won??t. We still have a lot of learning to do. Just like everyone else on the Web, we don??t know what the mix of revenue will be subscription, advertising, or promotions. "
Doc1520,microsoft ,1997," Digital Nervous System I use the phrase digital nervous system to mean the electronic system that companies use to solve business and customer problems. A great digital nervous system starts with a powerful operating system and network, but if any business is to automate, it also has to have a great database system and messaging system. Microsoft has, over the years, invested heavily in the technical development of Microsoft SQL Server?? and Microsoft Exchange, as well as other components of Microsoft BackOffice, hiring the best people and building products with great performance and interoperability. "
Doc1521,microsoft ,1997, This year we are also going to invest heavily in the technical and marketing support of software developers and solution providers in vertical markets. We want to ensure that virtually any customer will be able to find their specific business application on a high-performance Windows-based system. You??re also going to see broader coverage of corporate accounts worldwide. These are major investments in a time of moderate sales growth. 
Doc1522,microsoft ,1997," On May 20, we met with customers on Scalability Day, an important milestone because we demonstrated that any company, of any size, can run its business on our software, using solutions built on top of PC hardware. Hardware manufacturers have been busy producing world-class machines for a fraction of the price of mainframes. I am very optimistic that customers in the enterprise space will recognize, as they have on the desktop, that increasing performance, rising quality and falling prices make personal computer servers the best choice. "
Doc1523,microsoft ,1997," Simplicity In fiscal 1998, we expect to spend nearly $2.6 billion on research and development, broadly defined. It??s very exciting for me to see Microsoft bringing in world-class experts to work on areas like networking, security, graphics and linguistics. "
Doc1524,microsoft ,1997," Our industry makes incredible productivity devices that are impacting people around the world. But the complexity of technology has prevented users and system administrators from getting maximum value from their investments. Across the board, in applications, tools, desktop and server systems and interactive content, we have to make things simpler for users and system administrators. The three broad areas are Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and manageability, reducing complexity, and new, simpler devices on the low-end. "
Doc1525,microsoft ,1997, Total Cost of Ownership. Addressing TCO is important for companies of all sizes. And the issue is not just reducing costs it??s about increasing usability and functionality without increasing complexity. Our Zero Administration Initiative is the focus here. 
Doc1526,microsoft ,1997," We believe every knowledge worker should have a personal computer. We believe employees are more than cogs in a machine. We believe businesses succeed because of the intelligence and creativity of their employees. We believe that in order for a business to stay competitive in this fast-paced world, it needs a digital approach. But to allow our customers to reap the true rewards of building a digital nervous system, we need to help them get off the treadmill of having to dedicate so many of their resources just to keep systems up and running. "
Doc1527,microsoft ,1997," Windows NT Server 5.0 is a major breakthrough in addressing TCO issues. It will allow an organization to easily control user configurations, to intelligently mirror the client machine??s state on the server, and to allow users to roam from machine to machine. We also will enable mobile users to get the full benefit of their machines while traveling and have the ability to fully synchronize with the server when they return, so their local data and system state are protected. We will combine the power and flexibility of the PC with the benefits of central management. "
Doc1528,microsoft ,1997," Reducing complexity. Though we firmly believe in the power of the personal computer, it??s not always true that one size fits all. Some customers have older PC hardware that for various reasons they are not ready to upgrade. Some need a simpler, standard configuration for many workers. Some customers have existing investments in terminals. "
Doc1529,microsoft ,1997," We have worked with other companies to introduce the NetPC and Windows-based terminals. The NetPC is a simpler, easily managed PC configuration for corporate desktops that PC manufacturers are beginning to roll out now. The technology behind Windows-based terminals helps customers by extending the life of older, less-powerful PCs by running a limited number of newer applications off a server, and opens a new customer segment to us. "
Doc1530,microsoft ,1997, New devices. Windows Everywhere means we??re scaling down as well as up. Our Windows CE operating system is initially focused on handheld devices. Users will range from retail clerks monitoring inventory to healthcare workers charting patients to utility workers installing electrical lines. 
Doc1531,microsoft ,1997," Windows CE will also be suitable for still smaller wallet PCs, wireless-communication devices such as digital information pagers and cellular smart phones, next-generation entertainment and multimedia consoles, including game machines and smarter DVD players and purpose-built Internet access devices such as WebTVs, digital set-top boxes for cable and satellite systems and Internet Web phones. "
Doc1532,microsoft ,1997," Connected PCs, Connected TVs We??ve long held the belief that the PC was moving from the stand-alone PC to the connected PC. Today, this is well under way. PC networks are broadly prevalent in business, and the Internet is creating a worldwide web of PCs. Windows NT 5.0 and Windows 98 will do more to make PCs connected. Our vision has now evolved to the Connected PC and the Connected TV the idea of integrating the intelligence and interactivity of PCs with the video and sound of TV. This will accelerate as TV moves to a digital format. Making this vision a reality is reliant on the physical infrastructure the high-speed connections that will join these devices. Earlier this year, we invested in Comcast, the U.S.??s fourth-largest cable company, primarily to spur the cable and phone industries to build two-way, high-speed networks. We acquired WebTV to hasten the day when TVs and PCs use Windows technologies, providing complementary sources of information and entertainment in the home. Windows CE, a compatible subset of our Windows family, makes it a lot easier for consumer electronics manufacturers to do things such as a customized guide to television shows or applications to let you view Web pages and see simple electronic mail on your TV, control home heating and lighting systems or even let you connect up a digital camera and post or e-mail photos using the Internet. "
Doc1533,microsoft ,1997," These developments, and our work in IMG, will help make the Web lifestyle a reality. This is a lifestyle in which people take advantage of the Internet to lead more informed and productive lives, and have more fun. With a Web lifestyle, people will naturally turn to the Internet first to get information, manage their finances, make better purchase and travel decisions and communicate with friends and others with whom they have common interests. "
Doc1534,microsoft ,1997," Our business is one of risks and challenges and great potential rewards. I appreciate the continuing trust and support of our shareholders in the long-term vision and potential of this company. I am confident that through the dedication and hard work of our employees, we can deliver the products and services that will mean success for both Microsoft and our customers. "
Doc1535,microsoft ,1998,"Microsoft had another remarkable year in 1998. We made major advances in all our key businesses. The demand for great software that helps people work, communicate, and learn is stronger than ever. Our products are doing well because they deliver on these needs. "
Doc1536,microsoft ,1998," Microsoft?? Windows?? 98 is proving a great success. Customers appreciate its ability to work better and play better, while its robustness means that Windows 98 is generating less than half the customer calls of its predecessor. Integrated with the latest Internet Explorer technology, Windows 98 helps our customers leverage the interactivity of the Internet with the intelligence of the PC. Microsoft Windows NT?? Workstation is making deeper inroads onto the desktop, based on its productivity, reliability, and lower total cost of ownership. And Microsoft Windows CE, a compact version of the Windows operating system designed for a wide range of intelligent devices, is finding its way into everything from interactive televisions to hand-held computers. "
Doc1537,microsoft ,1998," Licensed sales of Microsoft Office 97 are strong, as our productivity applications continue to set the standard for features, functionality, and integration. Microsoft Office 2000, which is scheduled to come out in the first half of 1999, will take each of these factors to a significantly higher level, offering a simpler, personalized interface that learns each user's working style and adapts to it, plus many other productivity-enhancing features.Likewise our development tools continue to lead the market with the release of Visual Studio?? 6.0. "
Doc1538,microsoft ,1998," Microsoft Windows NT Server and Microsoft BackOffice?? applications continue to make solid progress in the marketplace, and are now the clear enterprise solution of choice over the various UNIX-based platforms. Windows NT 5.0 will raise our platform's scalability to even higher levels, while offering customers the lowest possible total cost of ownership. Growth in the Microsoft SQL Server?? database in fiscal 1998 continued, and the launch of SQL Server 7.0 will maintain this momentum. In many installations our enterprise solutions already deliver the level of performance achieved by mainframes, combined with the benefits of the low cost PC model. Our goal now is to take that model even deeper into the mission-critical computing market. "
Doc1539,microsoft ,1998," Our interactive media and services strategy continues to advance, focusing on online services, packaged software, and hardware. In Expedia?? travel service, CarPoint?? automotive service, Hotmail, Microsoft Investor, Gaming Zone, and Microsoft HomeAdvisor?? real estate service we are building some of the most powerful brands on the Internet. Our strategy going forward is to unify these sites around the MSN?? brand, so customers can easily reach all of them via a single portal, msn.com. Combined with our packaged-software products, among them Microsoft Money, Encarta??, and games such as Flight Simulator, our strategy is to break down the barriers between online and offline products and services, making it even simpler and more enjoyable for our customers to experience the power of the Internet. "
Doc1540,microsoft ,1998, Another important effort for us is bringing the power of software and the Internet to the television with our WebTV?? product. We plan to more than double the installed base to over one million users during the next year based on the very positive word-of-mouth this product has generated. 
Doc1541,microsoft ,1998," Microsoft intends to invest heavily in all these businesses, in the firm belief that online services will eventually be a key element of our relationship with customers. But as I wrote last year, online is still at an early stage of development. However, we are learning fast and I am seeing increasing synergy between our online work and our software products. "
Doc1542,microsoft ,1998," The power of innovation Our product goals require breakthrough innovation. During fiscal 1999 Microsoft will invest more than $3 billion in research and development, broadly defined. Our research centers in Redmond, San Francisco, and Cambridge, England, now employ experts in everything from graphics to decision theory and advanced linguistics. "
Doc1543,microsoft ,1998," Much of Microsoft's research and development is focused on making our products easier to use, even as the underlying software grows more complex, so our customers don't have to learn as many utilities and commands. Simplifying the user interface is our top priority. The adaptive user interface in Microsoft Office 2000 will tailor each copy of the application to the individual customer, personalizing menus so that your copy of Office 2000 helps you use it in the most productive way. Natural language processing automatically detects which language you are typing in, and assigns the appropriate proofing tools and user interface. If you inadvertently delete some of the application's files, it's smart enough to repair the damage. "
Doc1544,microsoft ,1998," Microsoft will also unify and simplify how PCs and networks store and handle information. At present, information is scattered about file systems, message stores, Web caches, directory services, and databases. This is complicated for developers and system managers, and confusing for customers. Sharing a calendar across the Internet, or personal information across Web sites, is very difficult. By unifying storage across all these media, Microsoft will help make information anytime, anywhere a reality. As consumers require all their information to be accessible from any Internet device and any location, the boundary between Web sites and software products will blur. "
Doc1545,microsoft ,1998," In time, computers will see, speak, read handwriting, listen, and learn. We will include these new input techniques into our products. Microsoft SQL Server 7.0, for example, already has a natural language interface that allows our customers to search their databases using questions phrased in everyday English. "
Doc1546,microsoft ,1998," Caring about customers To build on our already strong commitment to customers, we plan to increase by $200 million our spending on technical support, information-technology consultants, and other customer initiatives. We are listening carefully and constantly to our customers and partners to really understand what they want from our products and services, both today and in the future. The feedback loop drives our priorities. "
Doc1547,microsoft ,1998," This effort is being led by Steve Ballmer, who was promoted to President of Microsoft in July. Steve's job is to ensure that every dollar we spend on technology, product development, marketing, and support is focused on delighting our customers. In recognition of just how central to Microsoft's thinking its customers are, in this year's annual report a few of them will tell you just what Microsoft and its products mean to their lives. "
Doc1548,microsoft ,1998, The coming year will test us on many fronts. We need to make our software simpler and easier to deploy as well as making it more powerful. Pressure from competitors and regulators is intensifying. PC sales growth is slowing and a lot of the growth is in the consumer segment where software sales are lower than in the business segment. The growing size and diversity of our product portfolio means that we have to execute across a broadening front. 
Doc1549,microsoft ,1998," As Microsoft approaches the 21st century it faces many challenges and risks, but the opportunities are greater than ever. With continued innovation and hard work, I am convinced that we will reap the rewards. I appreciate the unwavering support and trust of our shareholders in these exciting times. "
Doc1550,microsoft ,1999,"Microsoft continued to perform strongly in 1999. Our customers count on us to provide great software that helps them communicate more effectively, work more productively, learn more creatively, and make the most of their leisure time. We worked hard to meet those needs and to set the standard for features, functionality, simplicity, and seamless integration with the Internet in all of our products. The result was remarkable growth and record revenue. "
Doc1551,microsoft ,1999," In the years ahead, we will see accelerating change in the software industry, as the computing needs of our customers start to move beyond the PC into a ??PC-Plus?? world. The PC will undoubtedly remain at the heart of computing at home, work, and school, but it will be joined by numerous new intelligent devices and appliances, from handheld computers and auto PCs to Internet-enabled cellular phones. More software will be delivered over the Internet, and the boundary between online services and software products will blur. The Internet will continue to change everything by offering a level of connectivity that was unimaginable only a few years ago   and every home, business, and school will want to be hooked up to that incredible global database. "
Doc1552,microsoft ,1999," Microsoft??s vision is to empower people through great software   any time, any place, and on any device. That means helping companies build friction-free knowledge-management systems, so information flows effortlessly through their businesses, and to implement flawless e-commerce operations. It means helping developers create great Web-enabled products for a wide range of devices. It means making PCs simpler and more reliable. It means helping consumers transform the Internet into their own ??personal Internet??   a resource that learns from them over time and empowers them with all of the information they need, while protecting their privacy. Everything we do focuses on allowing people and organizations to create and manage their information. "
Doc1553,microsoft ,1999," In a world of increasing technological complexity, one of our primary goals must be to make our products easier and more effective for customers to use. In part, this entails developing simpler interfaces, natural-language processing, and voice control to help hide the underlying complexity from users. We??re working hard to achieve those breakthroughs. But it also means getting closer to our customers and working harder to understand their needs. We must help customers integrate technology by learning about how they work, how information flows through their organization, what they??ll need in the future   and about where we??re succeeding or failing. Customer-centric thinking must permeate everything we do. "
Doc1554,microsoft ,1999," Our growth is always forcing us to look at the best way to stay close to our customers and respond to their needs. This year we organized the company so that its structure is customer-based rather than product-based. The leaders of each of Microsoft??s newly defined divisions now have end-to-end management accountability in their respective customer segments. Guided by the company??s overall vision, they have total responsibility for setting a clear mission and priorities for their division, including all product planning and marketing strategies. The divisional leaders also have freedom to form business relationships both inside and outside Microsoft   freedom to work with the parties they need to do the best job for their customers. "
Doc1555,microsoft ,1999," Microsoft??s mission has always been to connect customers with the information they need. But today there is more information to connect with than ever before, stored in more places than ever before, and accessible in more ways than ever before. By refocusing totally on offering customers what they want rather than what technology can provide, we will help them succeed in the PC-Plus world. We will also build a solid foundation for Microsoft well into the 21st century. "
Doc1556,microsoft ,1999," An organization??s most valuable asset is its knowledge base. It is also the hardest to manage. For the majority of knowledge workers, getting the information they need is still more difficult than it should be. Mostly, it involves creating and distributing paper documents or telephoning and meeting with fellow employees. New digital approaches enabled by our software will make knowledge workers far more efficient. "
Doc1557,microsoft ,1999," With its Web-based collaboration tools, Microsoft?? Office 2000 is already a powerful component of a knowledge management solution. In the coming year, we will augment it with several other key initiatives. Windows?? 2000 Active Directory?? service will simplify administration and make it easier for knowledge workers to find resources throughout their organization. Future versions of Microsoft Exchange will offer both a platform for unified messaging and our Web Store technology, creating a powerful, centralized communications and knowledge management solution. In the future, we plan to introduce document library and search server technology that will help companies leverage their knowledge bases. Because 50% of work is now done in teams compared with only 20% a decade ago   we have added team productivity features to the BackOffice?? family and other products. And to help organizations realize the dream of a paperless office, our ClearType technology offers on-screen resolution and readability that equals or exceeds that of paper. "
Doc1558,microsoft ,1999," To help knowledge workers access information more efficiently, we??re also developing what we call a digital dashboard. The digital dashboard is a customized Office 2000 solution that pulls together all of the information that is important to you regardless of whether it??s on your PC, corporate network, or the Internet   and makes it available in one place. A digital dashboard helps you manage and prioritize messages, tasks, information, meetings   in fact, whatever you want. It also gives you access to all of the analytical tools you need to process your data. And it makes all of this available wherever you are, whether on your handheld computer, PC, or smart telephone. The digital dashboard will bring the concept of empowerment any time, any place, and on any device even closer to reality. "
Doc1559,microsoft ,1999," Microsoft??s fundamental vision for Windows is one of total scalability   from embedded operating systems in smart devices such as thermostats and light switches, through Windows CE on handheld PCs, and Webenabled telephones, to the largest mission-critical server farms. Windows 2000, SQL Server?? 7.0, and the next version of Exchange will take our high-end scalability and around-the-clock availability far beyond what was thought possible just five years ago, and we expect to make even greater progress in the years ahead. A key to this is using Windows 2000 breakthrough loadbalancing to provide scaling and reliability beyond that of the most expensive systems of the past. Web sites can use Windows to easily add capacity and avoid having a single point of failure. The Windows 2000 load-balancing technology automatically redirects tasks to the server that is operating under the least load. "
Doc1560,microsoft ,1999," A core requirement of knowledge workers is access to their information wherever they are. Our IntelliMirrorTM technology in Windows 2000 will help make that possible, by transparently and automatically backing up and synchronizing your data so that it is available on PCs or intelligent devices. "
Doc1561,microsoft ,1999," Your handheld computer, Web-enabled telephone, and PC will synchronize with each other wirelessly and automatically, whether you are in your office or on the road. At Microsoft, some of our employees already use Windows 2000 with a wireless network. When they walk into a meeting room, their laptop is automatically recognized and a ??virtual workgroup?? of everyone in the room is created. Wireless networks will transform the workplace. "
Doc1562,microsoft ,1999," Ubiquitous connectivity will also revolutionize the home, enabling consumers to leverage the power and richness of the PC on any intelligent device, thanks to fast, low-cost wireless networks that will make high-quality audio and video available in every room. For example, our Windows Media?? audio player downloads music twice as fast as previous formats, has double the storage capacity, and offers powerful anti -piracy protection. We??re also evolving the WebTV Network?? service, which today has more than 800,000 subscribers, with on-demand programming, personalized viewing, more Web-enhanced content, great games, and powerful communications for the whole family. We aim to help millions of Americans enjoy the digital lifestyle at home as well as at work with exciting offerings such as the CarPoint?? online automotive service, HomeAdvisor?? online real estate service, MoneyCentral?? personal finance service, plus the MSNTM Hotmail Web-based e-mail service, which now has more than 40 million members. "
Doc1563,microsoft ,1999," Microsoft??s vision of empowering people through great software   any time, any place, and on any device   depends on helping consumers and businesses advance from today??s narrow-band world into a broadband future. Even now, the majority of consumers   along with many small and medium-sized businesses   still access the Internet via their regular telephone lines. The result is that the rich world of real-time interactivity remains a dream for most consumers, while many businesses are reluctant to put videoconferencing or multimedia on their networks, because they fear it will crowd out transaction traffic and other high-priority communications. "
Doc1564,microsoft ,1999," Our core strategy here is to make investments that will accelerate the deployment of high-speed broadband networks and to collaborate on the technology that will make interactive services for consumers and businesses run seamlessly across these networks. To that end, we are working with companies that will play a leading role in making broadband Internet and multimedia access widely available. We are enthusiastic about the many technologies that will deliver this, which is why we continue to invest in various infrastructures such as wired and wireless telecommunications, cable, and interactive television. Some of our exciting relationships include AT&T, Nextel Communications, NTL, Rogers Communications, WirelessKnowledge, Concentric Networks, Wink Communications, and more. "
Doc1565,microsoft ,1999," The enduring popularity of the PC   more than 100 million should be sold worldwide this year is amazing, but not surprising. In a single, economical package, the PC offers individual students, knowledge workers, and consumers the kind of computing power that was found only in corporate computing departments just a decade ago. Whether you want to communicate, learn, work, or play, the PC can enrich and improve the experience. "
Doc1566,microsoft ,1999," In the new millennium, the remarkable power and flexibility of the PC will be available wherever it is needed. The PC-Plus era will be about connectivity, scalability, and simplicity. It will be an era when people are at the center, where technology is a natural extension of the way consumers and businesses think about themselves and their interactions with others. The combination of experience, resources, and research that is unique to Microsoft puts us in a strong position to transform this vision into reality. "
Doc1567,microsoft ,1999," We are investing heavily in the future   from world-class customer support to the $3.8 billion we plan to spend in fiscal 2000 on research and development for the products of tomorrow. There is, however, no guarantee of success. Competition continues to intensify, and regulatory pressures are unlikely to ease. Although global PC sales have proved remarkably robust, some slowdown is likely in the coming year. And as Microsoft??s business becomes more complex, the strategic challenges and risks we face grow exponentially. "
Doc1568,microsoft ,1999," I remain optimistic, because the new opportunities for great software products are still incredible. I appreciate the unwavering support and trust of our shareholders and customers as Microsoft enters the 21st century. "
Doc1569,microsoft ,2000,"In 1975, Microsoft had three employees, $16,000 in revenue and a single software product   a version of the BASIC computer language that ran the first personal computer, the Altair 8800. "
Doc1570,microsoft ,2000," In 2000, as we mark our 25th year, Microsoft is the world??s largest software company, with nearly 40,000 employees, $23 billion in revenue, and a wide range of powerful software and Internet products, including the most popular PC operating system, productivity software and Internet network. "
Doc1571,microsoft ,2000," It??s been truly amazing to be at the focal point of two revolutions that have swept the world since Microsoft??s modest beginnings: a PC revolution that has made powerful and affordable computing available to hundreds of millions of people around the globe, and an Internet revolution that is fundamentally changing how people communicate, learn and share information, and the way entire industries operate. "
Doc1572,microsoft ,2000," At the core of these remarkable advances is software   the magic that makes this technology useful. At Microsoft, software is our passion, the reason we??re excited to come to work every morning. As we look to the future, our commitment to advance the frontiers of software technology offers extraordinary opportunities for consumers, businesses and our company. "
Doc1573,microsoft ,2000," With the release of Windows?? 2000, the continuing strength of Microsoft?? Office, our expanding enterprise server family and the surging popularity of MSN??, we have strong core businesses. At the same time, we are making significant strategic investments for the future in key growth areas, including wireless technologies, digital devices, games, TV, small business and, most important, the new Microsoft .NET platform. Over the next year, we will invest more than $4 billion in research and development to advance our core businesses, build on our strategic investments and deliver on the promise of our most important software initiative ever Microsoft .NET. "
Doc1574,microsoft ,2000," Just as our development of PC operating systems and other software technologies have driven growth in the industry over the past quarter century, today we are working to enable a new era of empowerment for computer users, and growth opportunities for both businesses and software developers. Microsoft .NET comprises the software and services that will power the Next Generation Internet. "
Doc1575,microsoft ,2000," As anyone who has used a PC knows, today??s Internet experience can be fun, exciting and informative. It also can be confusing and difficult. For example, Web browsing, content authoring and editing, e-mail, calendaring and contacts each require separate applications that have widely varying functionality and compatibility. Communicating between devices such as PCs, mobile phones and handheld devices is challenging at best. Meanwhile, information on the Internet continues to exist on ??digital islands?? of independent Web sites. This information is easy to browse, but difficult to edit or manipulate in any useful way. There is enormous benefit and opportunity in linking these isolated islands of data, services and devices in ways that will enable people and businesses to communicate and collaborate more easily. This is where Microsoft .NET comes into play, enabling easier, more personalized and more productive Internet experiences by harnessing constellations of smart devices and Web sites with advanced software based on open Internet standards and protocols, including XML. In addition, Microsoft .NET will offer computer users a unified interface that adapts to whatever they are doing, wherever they are, and is device-independent   a kind of ??universal canvas?? for the Digital Age. "
Doc1576,microsoft ,2000," Microsoft .NET will create immense opportunity for hundreds of thousands of developers and industry partners, by providing the tools to build a new generation of truly distributed Web services that will transform the Internet and every other aspect of computing. Microsoft .NET will revolutionize computing and communications in the first decade of the 21st century, by being the first platform that takes full advantage of both. Microsoft .NET will take several years to come to full fruition, but we are tremendously excited about the potential. "
Doc1577,microsoft ,2000," Microsoft .NET will build extensively on Microsoft??s current core businesses, including the Windows family of desktop and server operating systems, enterprise server applications, Microsoft Office and MSN, each of which is performing strongly today. Windows 2000 has met with strong customer adoption and highly favorable reviews among IT managers, office users and industry analysts, making it the most powerful business operating system ever released by Microsoft. Underscoring its reliability and the value of its new features, General Motors, Royal Dutch/Shell, Xerox Corp., and leading PC manufacturers   such as Compaq Computer Corp., Dell Computer Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., IBM Corp., and Toshiba Corp.   are all deploying Windows 2000. "
Doc1578,microsoft ,2000," Windows Me, the latest version of the Windows operating system designed specifically for home users, released in September, provides consumers with an improved user and Internet experience, enhanced home-based networking features and compelling new digital media tools. "
Doc1579,microsoft ,2000," Today, Windows 2000 servers are powering the World Wide Web. A majority of the top Internet retail sites, business-to-business Web sites and secure Web sites are running on Windows 2000 Server or Windows 2000 Advanced Server, and more Fortune 500 sites are running on Windows 2000 technology than any other technology. Windows 2000 Datacenter Server, launched in September 2000, will provide even more power and reliability for high-traffic networks. "

Doc1581,microsoft ,2000," Microsoft Office revenue was strong as major enterprise accounts continued to adopt the world??s most popular productivity suite. The growing deployment of Windows 2000 on the desktop is expected to further stimulate sales of Office 2000. New technologies that integrate Web services directly into the Office user experience, as well as tools that enable users to more efficiently store, access and analyze crucial business information, are being developed for future versions of Microsoft Office. Office.NET will offer a powerful productivity and communications service designed to meet the needs of 21st century knowledge workers. Use of Microsoft??s Visio?? and Microsoft Project applications is also continuing to grow and empower knowledge workers in important new ways. "
Doc1582,microsoft ,2000," Fiscal year 2000 was a defining year for MSN. In June, the MSN network of Internet services became the #1 worldwide Internet destination for consumers. In the United States, MSN grew significantly faster than Yahoo! or AOL. With MSN services available in 33 international markets and 17 languages, it is the #1 site among consumers in many countries around the world. Our MSN Internet Access business grew by more than 50 percent. Key to this remarkable growth is MSN best-of-breed services, including MSN Hotmail??, the world??s largest e-mail system with more than 67 million active accounts; MSN Messenger Service, our instant messaging service with more than 18 million users; MSN Search, the second most popular search service on the Web; and MSN eShop, which experienced a significant increase in holiday traffic last year. "
Doc1583,microsoft ,2000," Investments in Tomorrow One of the keys to Microsoft??s success over our first 25 years is the long-term view we have taken toward the development of technologies such as Windows, Office, MSN and other products. In the coming year, we will continue to focus on promising new technological advances in a number of key fields. "
Doc1584,microsoft ,2000," Television Digital and enhanced television products and services represent a significant growth opportunity for Microsoft and one that will give consumers more choice and control over when and what they watch, richer participation with TV programming, and convenient access to the Internet and family and friends. Microsoft is investing in three areas: "
Doc1585,microsoft ,2000," Working with television service operators   including AT&T in the United States, UPC in Europe, Rogers in Canada, and Towngas/iCare in Hong Kong   to deploy enhanced TV to more than 15 million subscribers via the Microsoft platform; "
Doc1586,microsoft ,2000," Joining with DIRECTV, Thomson, and Sony to produce UltimateTV, a one-box, one-service enhanced TV solution that will include two digital tuners to enable background recording, and a 40-gigabyte hard drive capable of recording 35 hours of TV programming. "
Doc1587,microsoft ,2000," Continuing to grow the WebTV?? service, which now has more than 1 million subscribers who can participate in new ways with their favorite TV shows, vote in live polls, receive up-to-theminute news coverage, and send and receive e-mail using their TV set at home. "
Doc1588,microsoft ,2000," Games In the last few years, Microsoft has emerged as one of the top PC games publishers in the United States. In calendar 1999, Microsoft had two of the top five best sellers: Flight Simulator and Age of Empires??. During the 1999 holiday season, we were the only games publisher with three titles on the Top 10 list. Building on this success, Microsoft is investing significant resources to develop Xbox??, which will compete with the Sony PlayStation and game consoles by Sega and Nintendo in a multi-billion-dollar industry. The hardware design for Xbox is already complete, and Microsoft has 30 game titles for it under development in-house, with more in the works by thirdparty developers. The fall 2001 launch of Xbox will be Microsoft??s biggest ever   larger even than Windows 95. "
Doc1589,microsoft ,2000," Wireless Microsoft will invest substantially in the coming year to enable truly intelligent communications that fluidly traverse the boundaries of work, individual and family time, while offering ways to control the tremendous volume of available information. Alliances are key to our wireless strategy. For example, we are working with AT&T and British Telecommunications on mobile applications for next-generation data networks; with NTT DoCoMo of Tokyo to develop wireless portals; and with Ericsson to create end-to-end solutions and services for the wireless Internet. "
Doc1590,microsoft ,2000," One of the biggest opportunities is working with network operators and carriers to empower their service platforms with Microsoft??s existing and emerging technologies. The building blocks of .NET will further enhance the types of services we will be able to provide. Microsoft is developing platforms and applications for a variety of mobile handheld devices, including cellular/mobile phones, Pocket PCs and smart phones. These devices will offer both voice and rich data capabilities, including true HTML Web browsing on color displays. Our research in smart cards, location-based services, and speech technologies will also have important applications in the wireless arena. "
Doc1591,microsoft ,2000," Small Business A great opportunity exists for Microsoft to help small businesses increase productivity and take advantage of the Internet to connect in new ways with customers, industry partners, and suppliers. Today, small businesses represent nearly 60 percent of the global economy. Yet their investments in software are far smaller per desktop than larger enterprises, even as they are being increasingly impacted by the digital economy. "
Doc1592,microsoft ,2000," The emergence of the Internet and .NET services will make technology more accessible and relevant to small businesses than ever before. By providing complete business solutions that include productivity, customer management and collaboration software, as well as technologies to power the specific needs of small-business operations and e-commerce, Microsoft can enable small businesses to better use technology to their business advantage. Over the next four years, technology spending by small businesses is forecast to increase by more than $50 billion. With more than 1 million registered users, bCentral??, Microsoft??s Web-based small-business portal is already #1 in terms of reach. Over the next year, bCentral will deliver a number of new Web services, as well as launch in five additional countries. We will also be launching a new version of the leading small-business server suite, Small Business Server 2000. "
Doc1593,microsoft ,2000," Building the Future Together In partnership with thousands of other technology companies that share our vision of highperformance, affordable computing, Microsoft has helped build a high-tech industry that is thriving on innovation and competition, and driving growth in the U.S. economy. That is one of the reasons why we believe the appellate courts will rule in Microsoft??s favor in the antitrust lawsuit and uphold the well-established legal precedent that U.S. antitrust law should encourage, not discourage, firms to improve their products rapidly to meet customer needs. We also believe the appellate courts will recognize that the district court??s order to break up Microsoft and impose crippling regulations reached far beyond the facts of the case, and would lead to less innovation, fewer choices and higher prices. "
Doc1594,microsoft ,2000," Finally, on the occasion of Microsoft??s 25th anniversary, we would like to take a moment to acknowledge the passionate, smart, dedicated employees who have helped make Microsoft the global leader in software, as well as our millions of shareholders, thousands of business partners, and hundreds of millions of customers around the world who have enabled the company to succeed over the years. The future is filled with amazing possibilities and opportunities, and our passion for improving people??s lives through great software will allow us to contribute even more than in our first 25 years. "
Doc1595,microsoft ,2001,"Twenty years ago, the MS-DOS??-based IBM PC had a tiny processor, a minuscule amount of memory, an even smaller amount of storage, and sold for $1,595   equivalent to more than $3,000 in today??s dollars. Even so, it was a remarkable advance in technology. Today, a PC that is thousands of times more powerful sells for less than $800. But it??s not just the power and the price that have changed so dramatically over the last two decades. What??s most remarkable is how software advances have made the PC an increasingly indispensable and versatile tool in the workplace, at home and at school. "
Doc1596,microsoft ,2001," Other electronic advances of this century, like the radio, the TV and the fax machine   while breakthroughs to be sure   have but one use. Software makes the PC, by comparison, a multi-talented workhorse. Software powers the operations of the world??s largest businesses. It enables people to shop for cars, books, music or just about anything else from the convenience of their home. Software facilitates instantaneous communication between people living in Sydney and Sao Paulo. And it helps junior high school students in New York do research for their classes. "
Doc1597,microsoft ,2001," Even more amazing are the opportunities ahead. As software grows increasingly dynamic, flexible and responsive, the PC is becoming the hub of an expanding universe of software-connected devices that will enable businesses and people to realize their potential. "
Doc1598,microsoft ,2001," Fiscal 2001 was a year of solid customer enthusiasm for Microsoft products and services   all the more significant considering the challenging economic climate and turbulence in the technology industry. Revenues increased by $2.34 billion to $25.3 billion, and operating income increased by $710 million to $11.72 billion. "
Doc1599,microsoft ,2001," The Windows family of products turned in a strong performance, led by brisk sales of Windows 2000 Professional. Microsoft SQL Server?? 2000 and Exchange 2000 Server drove record revenues for Microsoft??s rapidly growing enterprise server business. Our productivity and business-services offerings expanded significantly with the launch of Office XP   the newest version of Microsoft??s business productivity suite   and the acquisition of Great Plains Software, Inc., a leading supplier of mid-market business applications. Microsoft??s consumer software and services business, led by MSN momentum, grew at an impressive 20 percent rate, despite a rugged environment in the online space. "

We will extend and advance the range and abilities of Microsoft??s Windows .NET Server operating systems and .NET Enterprise Server applications, and deploy new solution offerings that help businesses connect with customers, integrate seamlessly with partners, enable employees and extend into new business opportunities. We will see continued adoption of our flagship Office XP suite for knowledge workers, and expansion of our Great Plains?? business applications. The developer community is eagerly anticipating the release of Visual Studio?? .NET, Microsoft??s rapid application-development tool for building next -generation Web applications and XML Web services. And we will continue to see significant growth in MSN Internet access and network services. "
Doc1607,microsoft ,2001," Microsoft .NET and XML Web Services In addition to these major new product launches, Microsoft is laying a solid framework for the future with a projected investment of approximately $5 billion in research and development in fiscal 2002. At the center of our R&D efforts is Microsoft .NET, an innovative effort as significant in the development of computing as the graphical user interface and the introduction of the Internet. .NET is Microsoft??s platform for a new computing model built around XML Web Services. Just as the Web revolutionized how users interact with content, XML is revolutionizing how applications communicate with data and how computers and devices communicate   by providing a universal data format that lets information be easily shared, adapted or transformed. .NET will create new opportunities for Microsoft and for thousands of developers and industry partners by enabling constellations of PCs, servers, smart devices and Internetbased services to collaborate seamlessly. Businesses will be able to integrate their processes, share data and join forces to offer customers much more dynamic, personalized and productive experiences   across the PC and an expanding universe of devices   than are available today. "
Doc1608,microsoft ,2001," In 1995, Microsoft??s primary business and revenue stream was from our desktop products   Windows and Office. In 2002, desktop products will still provide the majority of our revenue, although our server and enterprise business is a rapidly growing contributor to our overall revenues, and MSN, Xbox and other emerging businesses continue to expand our foundation for the future. Over the next five years, as we infuse XML Web Services into all our businesses, we see the opportunities for growth continuing. This transformation is key to expanding our revenue stream moving forward. "
Doc1609,microsoft ,2001," People As we expect to grow this year to more than 50,000 employees, we will continue to put a high priority on developing our next generation of business leaders, and ensuring that we have the appropriate management initiatives and tools to enable and empower a creative work environment. Our attrition rate at 8 percent annually   is less than half the average of the overall software and IT-services industry. Meanwhile, we continue to explore new ways to foster a progressive work environment that attracts and inspires bright, passionate people who are committed to continuously improving our products, and to creating a collaborative work environment where individual excellence and teamwork is rewarded. Facilitating a diverse workforce at Microsoft and within our industry continues to be an important priority. "
Doc1610,microsoft ,2001, The Antitrust Lawsuit Microsoft is committed to continuing to deliver innovations to customers and new opportunities for partners and the technology industry as a whole. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruling in the antitrust lawsuit significantly narrowed a lower court ruling that threatened to stifle industry innovation. We are continuing to work vigorously to resolve the remaining issues in the case in a manner that will provide clarity to Microsoft and the marketplace while enabling Microsoft to meet the needs of consumers and the industry. 
Doc1611,microsoft ,2001," Industry Leadership As a successful company, we understand that we have a responsibility to provide leadership in the broader industry. Particularly given the difficult economic times, it??s important that our industry work together to build on the technological advances that have fueled productivity and growth over the last decade. Our work on .NET, XML Web Services and open industry standards are examples of the deep industry engagement to which Microsoft is dedicated. While vigorous competition will always be a healthy hallmark of our industry, we are also committed to building relationships   with partners and even competitors. "
Doc1612,microsoft ,2001," Two years ago, we outlined a set of values that have evolved since Microsoft??s founding and which capture the spirit of our business practices (microsoft.com/mscorp/values.htm). As we look to the future, the cultural assets that have been such an important part of Microsoft??s success over the past 25 years will continue to evolve. One of the most fundamental of these cultural attributes is our commitment to accountability. Accountability to customers by continuing to improve product satisfaction. Accountability to partners, including smaller businesses and start-ups, who share the vision of affordable, connected computing. Accountability to the technical community through support of resources that enable software developers to create the next generation of products and grow successful businesses. Accountability to shareholders by continuing to invest in growth opportunities for the future, while staying focused on managing our business today. "
Doc1613,microsoft ,2001," The Digital Decade Over the past 20 years the personal computer has transformed the way people work, communicate, learn and play. It has stimulated productivity and collaboration in the workplace, connected people around the world, and become a powerful and affordable tool for learning and entertainment. "
Doc1614,microsoft ,2001," Yet even greater technological advances are just ahead. XML Web Services will open up new possibilities in e-commerce, business planning, and customer service. Document and workflow management will become simpler and more comprehensive. Technologies such as the advanced speech and handwritingrecognition capabilities of the next -generation Tablet PC will transform the workplace for knowledge workers. Inexpensive, high-capacity disk drives, powerful audio and video capabilities and easy-to-use digital cameras will make the PC an entertainment and information hub for the home. "

"
Doc1622,microsoft ,2002," One of our key goals is to expand our role as a provider of software solutions for small- and midsized businesses. In July 2002, we acquired Navision, a leading global provider of integrated software for financial management and other business processes. Combining Navision with Microsoft Great Plains to form Microsoft Business Solutions, we now offer a wide range of applications and services that enable companies to reduce costs, streamline operations, and improve service. We are planning many new products for this market, including a solution for customer relationship management that will launch this fiscal year. "
Doc1623,microsoft ,2002," THE PROMISE OF .NET AND XML WEB SERVICES A significant portion of the company??s revenue growth over the next five years will come from Microsoft??s .NET architecture, which holds enormous potential to connect information, people, systems, and devices in fundamentally new and important ways. Using common industry standards based on XML, a universal language for describing and exchanging data, our goal is to enable seamless sharing of information across many platforms and programming languages, and over the Internet, with XML Web Services. "
Doc1624,microsoft ,2002," The potential of Web services is gaining wide support among software developers and leading technology providers. For example, the Web Services Interoperability Organization, formed by Microsoft and other industry leaders in early 2002 to provide guidance and best practices for developing XML Web services, now has more than 120 companies as members. "
Doc1625,microsoft ,2002," To provide software developers with the tools and infrastructure for building and deploying XML Web services and other .NET-connected solutions, we launched Visual Studio .NET and the .NET Framework in February 2002.

Doc1630,microsoft ,2002," Antitrust Lawsuit In November 2001, Microsoft and the Department of Justice announced a settlement of the threeyear- old antitrust dispute. Nine state attorneys general joined in the settlement, while nine others decided to continue with the case. The settlement requires significant changes in how we do business, and Microsoft is fully committed to carrying out these responsibilities. The consent decree is a tough but reasonable compromise that is good for the industry, good for consumers, and good for the economy. "
Doc1631,microsoft ,2002," Trustworthy Computing In January 2002, we outlined for employees what we believe is the highest priority for the company and for our industry over the next decade: building a computing environment for customers that is as reliable as the electricity that lights our homes. As a first step in achieving higher levels of reliability, security, privacy, and business integrity, Microsoft made many changes in our operational and business practices. Thousands of our engineers received special training in writing secure software. And we conducted intensive security analyses of every line of source code for Windows and other products. "
Doc1632,microsoft ,2002," These efforts are starting to show results. Security updates of Microsoft Outlook, for instance, were followed by a dramatic drop in the number of e-mail virus incidents.

"
Doc1634,microsoft ,2002," Business Integrity During the past year, a number of major corporations were rocked by financial scandals that damaged shareholder wealth and confidence. At Microsoft, we take our responsibilities to shareholders, customers, partners, and employees very seriously. We aim to be open and candid about the condition of our business and the risks we face. We seek to properly assess assets so they are never overvalued, and we look hard for any costs or liabilities that should be reflected in our financial results. Consistent with the values of honesty and integrity that we strive to live by, we have long disclosed complete details of the diluting effect of employee stock options on Microsoft??s earnings. "
Doc1635,microsoft ,2002," Stock options are an important way that Microsoft attracts and encourages great employees. For the two of us, the vast majority of our individual net worth is invested in stock ownership of the business. Since Microsoft went public in 1986, we have never taken stock options, and we never will. We hope this provides further assurance that our personal interests are directly aligned with the long-term interests of all shareholders. "

Like any business, however, we face challenges in the near- and mid-term. We are addressing them head-on. "
Doc1641,microsoft ,2003," One of the most important challenges lies in serving business customers. Having recently invested in Y2K upgrades and the Internet, businesses want their future technology investments to do more and cost less. Many enterprises are migrating their server networks from proprietary hardware running the UNIX operating system to less expensive alternatives built on Intel microprocessors. Microsoft can benefit from this shift because we provide customers with comprehensive, end-to-end technology solutions and unmatched value. Last year, our server and tools revenue increased 16 percent. "
Doc1642,microsoft ,2003," Some organizations migrating from UNIX are considering noncommercial software such as Linux and OpenOffice. While the initial cost of acquiring a stripped-down, do-it-yourself operating system may seem attractive, a growing body of independent research shows that our integrated platform provides not only greater functionality but also lower total cost of ownership in most common business functions. "

However, success and growth often bring challenges, and during 1998, we faced some especially difficult ones. In particular, our infrastructure and a number of our business processes were unable to support some of the needs of a rapidly growing public corporation. Pegasystems?? growing number of customers and staff, coupled with a lack of formality in our project management and finance functions, led to problems in some day-to-day aspects of running the business. Our challenges were compounded by the 1998 implementation of new accounting rules for software companies regarding the recognition of revenue from software sales. "
Doc1842,pegasystems ,1998," In hindsight, we were not well prepared for these stresses in 1998. In the third quarter, we had no alternative but to delay our financial reporting as we carefully reviewed our annual financial performance to date. When we were able to announce our results, prudent practice dictated that we restate several prior quarters of earnings. understandably, the third quarter delay and subsequent restatements led to considerable anxiety in the investor Community and with our prospective customers. As a result, our stock performance has been deeply disappointing. We have not lived up to the strong potential that we had as we entered the year. "
Doc1843,pegasystems ,1998," Pegasystems?? Board of Directors and senior management team have taken thoughtful steps to address our issues and improve your company. We amended and enhanced our internal management processes and accounting practices. We created a new project management methodology that we expect to improve both the delivery and quality of our solutions. We deepened relationships with many of our world-class customers, and forged important new alliances with technology leaders. We positioned our solutions within a global market, and laid the groundwork for a new class of Internet-enabled solutions that we believe can help to change the face of Customer Relationship Management forever. "
Doc1844,pegasystems ,1998," Stronger Business Through Strong Alliances In 1998, we built on our strategic relationships in three Ways. "
Doc1845,pegasystems ,1998," First, we formalized alliances with several world-class consulting firms, working with them to both support existing customer relationships and bid successfully on new business. These alliances allow Pegasystems?? customers to choose an implementation Strategy that best meets their needs, Working with systems integrators certified in the implementation of Pegasystems solutions. "
Doc1846,pegasystems ,1998," Second, we developed several new alliances that enhance and complement our solution offerings. For example, We strengthened our Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) and call center integration capabilities by joining forces with Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories, Inc. and GeoTel Communications Corporation. We will continue to seek opportunities to team with market leaders, to offer our customers choices and the ability to use Pegasystems products more broadly. "

Doc1848,pegasystems ,1998," Today, We are jointly developing applications that leverage our core capabilities in the payments, mutual funds, and credit card marketplace.

We also continue to make progress in the mutual fund market through our relationship with First Data Investor Services. "
Doc1849,pegasystems ,1998," Moving forward, we will focus our energy on developing select relationships that leverage our technology and provide both distribution channels and industry-specific expertise in our target markets. I expect these relationships to play an increasingly important role in Pegasystems?? distribution strategy in 1999 and 2000. We recently formed a ??private label?? group to better provide the specialized technical and marketing assistance these important allies need. In 1999, we look forward to delivering an increased volume of market-leading products for sale and support through these and other third-party distribution channels. "

"
Doc1900,realnetworks ,1997,"I??m very pleased to present our financial report for 1997. It was a very good year for ReaINetworks. Annual revenue grew in 1997 from $14.0 million to $32.7 million, an increase of 134%. Net loss for 1997 was $11.2 million up from $3.8 million in 1996. These increased expenditures enabled us to substantially expand our product development efforts, to successfully launch ReaIVideo and to both sustain our leadership in streaming audio and take the lead in streaming video. Our balance sheet remains strong, and late in 1997 we added more than $35 million in capital from the successful completion of our initial public offering. We ended the year in excellent financial health with $92 million in cash and investments. We are financially well-positioned to fund the dynamic growth expected in the streaming media market during the next several years. "
Doc1901,realnetworks ,1997," As a company, we believe the true potential of the Internet is to become a mass medium comparable in scope to radio and television. To achieve this potential, the Internet needs to deliver more than text and pictures - it must come alive with audio, video, animation and other streaming media. We are committed to making this vision a reality. Our products unite media companies with audiences, advertisers with broadcasters, products with buyers. Building on our successful introduction of ReaIAudio in 1995, we entered 1997 as the leading provider of streaming audio on the Internet. By the end of 1997 we had delivered a complete line of streaming audio and video products and services including new publishing tools, consumer products, server solutions, consulting and hosting services and a group of Web sites that, combined, are one of the top audio/video sites and one of the top 25 Internet destinations overall. "
Doc1902,realnetworks ,1997," Shortly after its introduction in February of 1997, ReaIVideo became the leading solution for streaming Internet and intranet video broadcasting. Building on this momentum, in October we released ReaISystem 5.0, the first complete, cross-platform solution for live and on-demand streaming media capable of large-scale distribution for both Internet and intranet broadcasting. ReaISystem also marked the introduction of commerce-enabled features like ad insertion and pay-per-view as well as ReaIFIash, streaming animation developed jointly with Macromedia. We also launched ReaIPubIisher, an easy-to-use tool for publishing streaming media and ReaIPresenter which enables PowerPoint presentations enhanced with ReaIAudio to be delivered over networks. These new features and others fueled rapid adoption of our ReaISystem and helped us exit 1997 with approximately 85% market share of all Internet pages using streaming media. "
Doc1903,realnetworks ,1997," Corporate intranets are a growing market for our technology and are key to our strategy. Major companies like Fujitsu Network Communications, Novell and Tandem have joined 3Com, The Boeing Company, GE Information Services, Lucent and MCI in deploying our streaming media solutions across their intranets. These companies, and others that have utilized streaming media, are able to realize tangible cost savings and increased productivity through better communications within their organizations. As the importance of intranets continues to grow, so does our opportunity. "
Doc1904,realnetworks ,1997," The consumer side of our business has flourished as well. Our ReaIPIayer registered user base grew from 4 million to 14 million over the course of 1997, and we now have surpassed the 20 million mark. By the end of 1997, over 100,000 people were downloading our ReaIPIayer software every day. Our enhanced ReaIPIayer Plus software is one of the most successful examples of electronic commerce on the Internet today, with over 500,000 copies sold in just 18 months. Our content aggregation and entertainment sites  Timecast, Daily Briefing, LiveConcerts.com, MusicNet and FiIm.com  allow Internet users immediate access to a wealth of streaming audio and video programs updated daily and delivered directly to their homes and desktops. The proven success of these sites helps us to further evangelize the power and promise of streaming media. Moreover, our Real brand is one of the most widely recognized on the Internet. "
Doc1905,realnetworks ,1997," As our market grew domestically, we also moved globally with the creation of three foreign subsidiaries. We incorporated our French and Japanese subsidiaries in November 1996 and our U.K. subsidiary in February 1997. Despite a slowdown in certain Asian markets towards the end of 1997. our international revenues went from 22% of total net revenues in 1996 to 26% of total net revenues in 1997. "
Doc1906,realnetworks ,1997," We're creating greater understanding about streaming media and building strong alliances. We have taken an open, extensible and comprehensive approach to our technology, creating a set of products and services that span the spectrum of Internet and intranet broadcasting needs and that enable other companies to add value to our products. Our 1997 ReaIMedia Conference brought together the leading Internet multimedia companies and hundreds of developers, content creators and corporate executives seeking answers about how to make their Internet and intranet sites more dynamic and profitable. We also entered into a diverse number of strategic relationships with companies like Microsoft, Macromedia, MCI, Sun, DEC and many others all designed to maximize market penetration, enhance validation and adoption of our technologies, aid content development, expand commercial activities and develop software protocols for proposed adoption as industry standards. "
Doc1907,realnetworks ,1997," These accomplishments were possible because we thrive on excellence, propelled by the desire to continuously innovate and improve our technology. We believe this emphasis, coupled with a cross-platform and open architecture, strong brand recognition and market share, and a high level of commitment to supporting our customers, will continue to place us at the forefront of the streaming media market. "
Doc1908,realnetworks ,1997," Going forward, we will work to maintain our market leadership by continuing to devote a significant portion of our resources to the research and development of new products. The Vivo Software acquisition in March of 1998 further strengthens and extends our market leadership position by adding their award winning technology, significant customer base and a number of highly talented people. "
Doc1909,realnetworks ,1997," I am proud of the contributions made over the past year by the entire staff of ReaINetworks. We have much to be optimistic about. We expect streaming media will continue to enhance the Internet and corporate intranets by creating new ways to communicate and conduct business. We remain committed to being the defining force behind this rapidly changing, incredibly promising new medium. "
Doc1910,realnetworks ,1998,"During 1998, RealNetworks continued to lead the streaming media industry. We have built our success on four fundamental building blocks. First, RealNetworks continues to develop and implement the best technology to deliver the richest programming on the Web. Second, we have achieved near ubiquity, both in terms of the distribution of our consumer products and in terms of the availability of rich media programming from RealNetworks streaming media servers. Third, RealNetworks has earned a strong market position by creating an interlocking ecosystem of significant streaming media partners. Finally, we continue to develop new and better products and services to easily connect consumers to the rich programming that our technology enables. "
Doc1911,realnetworks ,1998," technological innovation Perhaps nothing demonstrated RealNetworks' commitment to making the Internet into the next mass medium better than our introduction in November 1998 of the next generation streaming media system RealSystem G2. Winner of nearly every major product review, and judged by analysts and consumers alike to be the leading streaming media platform, RealSystem G2 introduced features, from SureStream to SMIL, which produce the best possible media experiences for our customers. "
Doc1912,realnetworks ,1998," Developing the best technology is only the first step. RealNetworks has continued to lead in the innovation of new technology and, with the AutoUpdate feature of the RealPlayer G2, we are able to upgrade our products on tens of millions of PCs in real-time. "
Doc1913,realnetworks ,1998," ubiquity of Pleallvetworks products By March 16, 1999,RealNetworks had registered 56 million unique users of the RealPlayer, a striking increase from the 14.5 million registered users at the end of 1997. Although this marked the largest absolute growth of any desktop application, RealNetworks measures the success of our products not just by their availability, but by their actual usage, In December 1998, according to Media Metrix, 15.5 million US households were using the RealPlayer each month, an increase of more than 300% over December 1997. The ubiquity and great popularity of the RealPlayer is linked in large part to the breadth of rich programming produced in RealNetworks formats. Altogether, more than 85% of all streaming Web pages are in our formats, with 300,000 hours of live streaming content being broadcast each week. "
Doc1914,realnetworks ,1998," The incredible growth of RealNetworks' reach meant that last year, for the first time, millions of people witnessed historical events such as the impeachment of President Clinton, military action in Iraq and John Glenn??s return to space, not on television or radio, but on the Web through the RealPlayer. No longer tied to the schedules of the traditional broadcast media, or needing to wait for snippets on the evening news, users around the world tuned in live or on demand using the RealPlayer to witness history unfolding. Just as CNN changed the face of live news reporting during the 1991 Persian Gulf War, in 1998 RealNetworks brought streaming media into the mainstream, and transformed forever the way people get information. "
Doc1915,realnetworks ,1998," the ReaINetworks streaming media ecosystem RealNetworks has helped to build an entire streaming media industry, responsible in part for our dramatic growth in 1998. This industry is an interlocking ecosystem of streaming media partners, including major media companies, infrastructure providers and major computing platform providers. ABC, Fox News, @Home, lnktomi, Enron, AOL, lntel IBM/Lotus and Netscape are just a few of the significant companies that have joined the growing community that recognize RealNetworks as the standard in streaming media.

Doc1916,realnetworks ,1998," connecting consumers to rich content One of the key factors in enabling the next mass medium is providing consumers with a simple way to easily locate and access the infinite number of streaming media programming choices afforded by the Internet. To this end, RealNetworks has been focused on delivering a number of new content aggregation properties. With RealPlayer G2, RealNetworks delivered new features such as RealChannels and expanded Presets, which enable consumers to instantly access live and on demand streaming media programming from leading media companies like CNN, ESPN, NPR, FOX and ABC directly from the RealPlayer. RealNetworks also launched the enhanced version of RealGuide, a destination Web site designed to provide consumers with a simple means of locating and accessing their desired programming from more than 85% of the streaming media Web pages on the lnternet. With the introduction of RealAudio and RealVideo search, consumers can key-word search for their desired streaming media programming from both RealPlayer G2 and from RealGuide. "
Doc1917,realnetworks ,1998," In 1998, FiealNetworks built the best streaming technology, the strongest market share, a strong partnership ecosystem and exciting consumer experiences. We helped transform the Internet into a mass medium and, in so doing, RealNetworks generated record revenues in 1998 of $64.8 million, an increase of 98% over 1997. The fourth quarter of 1998 represented our 14th consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth, and our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong, with approximately $100 million in cash and investments at the end of 1998. "
Doc1918,realnetworks ,1998," RealNetworks credits its success to the energy and creativity of our employees and management team, and to the strong support of you, our shareholders. We are focused on providing value over the long-term to our shareholders. "
Doc1919,realnetworks ,1998, We are proud of what we have accomplished in 1998. And we remain committed to leading the continued growth of this exciting new industry. The whole world is watching. 
Doc1920,realnetworks ,1999,"When we founded RealNetworks six years ago, it was hardly the conventional wisdom that the Internet would revolutionize audio and visual communication. The impact of this revolution has been truly profound and its pace staggering, even more impactful, I believe, than the transformation from radio to television in the 1950's. "
Doc1921,realnetworks ,1999," There are several reasons for this Internet media revolution. First, the Internet is a truly global medium, providing people the ability to broadcast media from anywhere In the world to anywhere in the world. Second, anyone not just those able to obtain an FCC broadcast license or carriage on cable systems - can be a broadcaster. There are now tens of thousands of channels on the Web broadcasting an incredible variety of content worldwide, certainly a dramatic expansion compared to the handful of programming choices available during the early years of television. And finally, the Internet uniquely makes it possible to deliver incredibly powerful programming that is completely personalized and interactive, integrating rich media programming with the virtually limitless information available on the Web. "
Doc1922,realnetworks ,1999," Since ??breaking the Internet sound barrier in 1995 with the introduction of RealAudio, we are extremely proud that a new communications medium has blossomed, with RealNetworks firmly at its center. We have led this fundamental transformation by retaining a single-minded focus on our vision of turning the Internet into the next great mass medium. ln 1997, we further propelled the Internet media market with the introduction of Realvideo. In 1998, we advanced the Internet media delivery system still further with RealSystem G2, the first truly integrated, open and extensible streaming media architecture. "
Doc1923,realnetworks ,1999," Demonstrating the strength of our vision, our user base more than doubled in 1999, ending the year with 95 million unique registered users of the RealPIayer. More than 85% of all streaming media Web pages utilize our technology. "
Doc1924,realnetworks ,1999," In May, RealNetworks built upon our leadership in streaming media over the Internet and entered the rapidly developing sphere of digital distribution of music, with the introduction of RealJukebox. We believe RealJukebox is the most rapidly adopted new Internet software product in history. Fully integrating support for a broad range of portable devices and music formats, RealJukebox quickly became the most popular digital music system, and ended the year with more than 20 million unique registered users. "
Doc1925,realnetworks ,1999," In November, in order to better connect consumers to content in the face of the rapid proliferation of media on the Internet, we launched the ReaI.com Network with more than 100 leading media partners. This powerful integration of consumer software and services rapidly demonstrated its impact in helping millions of consumers find the content they wanted, driving an estimated 200 million visits to our partners?? programming in just the first four months. "
Doc1926,realnetworks ,1999," At year??s end, as part of RealNetworks?? strategy to make the widescale delivery of broadband rich media a reality, we introduced a broadband-enhanced version of ReaISystem G2. This newest version of our industry-leading streaming media system builds on the considerable initiatives RealNetworks and its many partners have undertaken to build out a media delivery infrastructure which can deliver high-quality media programming to the widest Internet audience as we transition from a narrowband to a broadband world. In combining our ??best-of-breed technology with the unmatched depth and breadth of our partners, I am fully confident that RealNetworks is uniquely positioned to lead this exciting new industry, which we helped to create, into the broadband future. "
Doc1927,realnetworks ,1999," This was also a year marked by great achievements on the international front, further establishing ReaINetworks?? leadership in the global growth of Internet media. We have introduced eight international versions of the RealPlayer, localized with programming from and in the languages of our consumers in Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands and Spain. Additionally, more than 30 international media companies are providing branded program channels to the worldwide users of the RealPlayer. It is no surprise to us, therefore, that more than 40% of the registered users of the RealPlayer are from outside the U.S., and RealNetworks?? revenues from outside North America, which more than doubled over the past year, currently represent nearly 25% of total net revenue. "
Doc1928,realnetworks ,1999," Looking back on 1999, we are extremely proud of what we achieved over the course of an incredible year. We are particularly pleased that we have further solidified our ubiquity and leadership in Internet media delivery while, at the same time, becoming one of the first Internet companies to reach profitability. Our net revenues increased 98% to $131.2 million in 1999 and we reported net earnings of $8.9 million, or $.04 per diluted share. "
Doc1929,realnetworks ,1999," And looking ahead, we are even more excited about what the future holds for us. By remaining intensely focused on providing the best possible media experience to our users, and by helping our many partners build successful businesses around Internet media delivery, we plan to further strengthen our role as the recognized leader of this exciting new industry. "
Doc1930,realnetworks ,1999," All this is only possible because of the hard work and dedication of the more than 700 employees of RealNetworks worldwide, the support of our hundreds of partners in this exciting effort, and the confidence our shareholders have shown in our vision. "
Doc1931,realnetworks ,2000,2000 is a complicated year to summarize. 
Doc1932,realnetworks ,2000," On many fronts we achieved new heights. Revenue grew 84% to $241.5 million. Our worldwide consumer user base grew from more than 95 million unique registered users to more than 180 million. Usage in all of our core markets grew dramatically. We rolled out major breakthroughs in our systems technology, including RealVideo 8, RealAudio 8, and RealSystem iQ. I will have more to say on each of these topics later in this letter. "
Doc1933,realnetworks ,2000," On the other hand, the 4th quarter of 2000, while still pro-forma proNtable and cash-Oow positive, was the Nrst time in our history that we did not meet or exceed market expectations. If this were a one-time phenomenon, we would simply commit to quickly resuming our historical march towards increased revenue and proNts and go back to discussing our considerable accomplishments. However, the underlying drivers for the change in our Nnancial results are not trivial. They relate to a radical change in the Nnancial environment in which we do business, particularly in the way companies are buying and deploying systems software, which is our biggest business, and a dramatic drop-oA in the Internet advertising business, which is our 3rd largest revenue stream and also has ripple eAects on our systems customers. "
Doc1934,realnetworks ,2000," While both of these dramatic changes emanate from factors we believe are temporary I a worldwide economic slowdown and the end of a Nnancial market bubble centered on technology stocks I the impact of these changes will take several months to work through. During this period, RealNetworks is committed to (a) maintaining our leadership position in technology and continuing to drive innovation at a rapid rate; (b) building on our market leadership in every market in which we do business; (c) redoubling our eAort to support our customers as they achieve a true return-oninvestment based on our products and services; and (d) being smart in how we manage headcount and cost growth while also keeping in place the world-class team that got us this far in just 7 years. "
Doc1935,realnetworks ,2000," While many things are diAerent environmentally, our core strengths remain substantial and continue to grow. Even in a dramatically changed market environment, we've established a sustainable business model that is enabling us to build long-term value for all of our stakeholders, particularly you, our shareholders. "
Doc1936,realnetworks ,2000," Since RealNetworks broke the Internet sound barrier in 1995 with the introduction of RealAudio, the Internet has blossomed as a true mass medium. We have continued to play a central role through our constant Oow of technological innovations, investment in the growing audience on the Web, and our ability to connect content providers to that audience. We've revolutionized not only how the world watches, sees and listens I but also how it teaches, communicates and conducts business. Today, RealNetworks is the standard for Internet media creators and consumers and serves by far the largest and fastest growing audience for online entertainment and commerce. "
Doc1937,realnetworks ,2000," As the availability and adoption of broadband services continue to grow and the build-out of the middle of the network reduces the cost of delivering Internet media, RealNetworks is well positioned to capitalize on this attractive growth opportunity by: "
Doc1938,realnetworks ,2000," Delivering the largest Internet audience to content providers and advertisers worldwide, and connecting consumers to content "
Doc1939,realnetworks ,2000," Providing technology, products and services that create a universal media delivery platform for the Internet "
Doc1940,realnetworks ,2000, Creating compelling consumer services that leverage the ubiquity of our products and our extensive web of media relationships 
Doc1941,realnetworks ,2000, Making Internet media available on any device 
Doc1942,realnetworks ,2000," Largest Audience and Most Content In 2000, our installed base of unique registered users topped 180 million, a Ngure that has continued to grow by more than 200,000 per day. And now, with software available in 12 languages, RealNetworks is the most popular Internet media solution worldwide. More than 50 percent of our users are outside of the United States. Furthermore, over 85% of all Web pages that contain streaming media use RealAudio, RealVideo, or other RealNetworks formats. "
Doc1943,realnetworks ,2000," This audience, combined with the wealth of content, creates a critical mass of distribution power that puts RealNetworks in an enviable situation. Content providers, broadcasters, and content delivery networks want to reach this audience so they produce more content and thus continue to feed this sustainable network eAect. Not only do we have an unmatched franchise with the size of the RealPlayer user base, but it creates incredible opportunities to drive revenue end-to-end and extend our platform. "
Doc1944,realnetworks ,2000," Universal Media Delivery Platform With the introduction of RealSystem iQ, RealNetworks made a fundamental technological breakthrough by creating a universal platform for the delivery of media on the Internet, which is crucial to ensuring the continued development of the Internet as a true mass entertainment medium. RealSystem iQ has already earned widespread industry adoption I the major content delivery networks are building out their networks with RealSystem iQ, and the leading server companies I including Sun, IBM and HP I all support RealSystem iQ on their mission critical UNIX platforms. "
Doc1945,realnetworks ,2000," Compelling Consumer Products In 2000, RealNetworks launched RealPlayer GoldPass, which oAers subscribers an all-in-one package of premium software, services, and exclusive content. Though it was only introduced in August, by the end of the year, GoldPass had already drawn more than 125,000 paid subscribers and by the end of March 2001 that number crossed 200,000 I which we believe makes it the fastest growing paid content subscription service ever on the Internet. This ability to leverage our RealPlayer base is incredibly important to RealNetworks and the industry as it creates a clear path to recurring subscription revenues for Internet media. "
Doc1946,realnetworks ,2000," Internet Media Available on All Devices With more than one billion non-PC consumer appliances expected to be connected to the Internet worldwide in 2004, RealNetworks is enabling users of these devices to enjoy compelling, high quality experiences. In 2000, RealNetworks made great strides in establishing our technology as the standard for the newest generation of digital media devices. We formed important strategic alliances with device and component manufacturers including Sony, Nokia, Texas Instruments, Hewlett Packard, Intel, and Matsushita. These alliances build on long-standing relationships such as those with AOL, Liberate, Creative Labs, Panasonic, Diamond Multimedia, Sprint, WebTV, and others. "
Doc1947,realnetworks ,2000," I want to thank our dedicated employees, our hundreds of partners, the millions of consumers around the world who use RealNetworks' products and, you, our shareholders, for your ongoing support and conNdence in the long-term growth prospects for our company. We are committed to continuing to work hard to drive our business forward even during the current period of economic turbulence, and remain incredibly optimistic about the huge long-term opportunities in front of us. "
Doc1948,realnetworks ,2001,"Two thousand and one was a year that none of us will soon forget. Quite clearly, it was a year of great adversity and challenge for our country and society. "
Doc1949,realnetworks ,2001," It was also quite clearly a challenging year for several of the industries adjacent to RealNetworks?? business, which our 2001 results reflect. In particular, the bursting of the Internet financial ??bubble?? affected both the systems software and advertising parts of our business. For the first time in our company??s history, our annual revenue declined from the previous year, and our pro-forma profitability fell as well. "
Doc1950,realnetworks ,2001," I told you last year that the changes brought about by the end of the bubble would take some time to work through. This has indeed been the case. We spent a lot of effort during 2001 retooling for the post-bubble world while keeping our core strengths intact. I believe that we have come through the challenges of 2001 stronger than ever in terms of our product portfolio, customer relationships, business fundamentals, and prospects for the future. "
Doc1951,realnetworks ,2001," This past year, RealNetworks created and embraced strategic opportunities that have fortified our position as a true industry trendsetter, from both a consumer and technological standpoint. What??s more, we believe that the seeds planted in 2001 will continue yielding benefits to our shareholders for many years to come. "
Doc1952,realnetworks ,2001, Let??s take a look at the highlights: 
Doc1953,realnetworks ,2001," Ubiquity: In 2001, RealNetworks added more unique registered users than in any year in our history, bringing our worldwide base of users of our consumer products to over 250 million. RealNetworks has continued to lead the market overall   Nielsen//NetRatings reported that in December of 2001 U.S. home users of RealNetworks?? formats outpaced the nearest competitor by a two-to-one margin. "
Doc1954,realnetworks ,2001," RealOne: In 2001, RealNetworks launched RealOne, our most ambitious and compelling consumer offering ever. RealOne combines RealNetworks?? leading digital media player, the RealOne Player, with brand-name digital programming music, entertainment, sports and news from ABCNEWS.com, CNN, E! Networks, FOXSports.com, MLB, NASCAR.com, NBA and more. The RealOne experience provides users with the most enjoyable media-rich experience on the web. "
Doc1955,realnetworks ,2001," RealOne Player integrates the playback, download and management functions of RealPlayer and RealJukebox with a media browser and content discovery window. The entirely new user interface and functions increase the consumer??s ability to discover, play and manage digital media, empowering consumers to revolutionize their digital media experience. "
Doc1956,realnetworks ,2001," RealOne SuperPass is the successor to our very popular RealPlayer GoldPass content and software subscription service. With more than 500,000 paying subscribers in just 18 months, we have built the largest rich media subscription service on the Internet. And we??re just getting going. "
Doc1957,realnetworks ,2001, RealSystem: We continued to extend the reach of our RealSystem iQ delivery platform on a variety of fronts. Our strategy is fueled by what we call the ??four anys??: the ability to deliver media in any format from any operating system over any transport to any IP-enabled device. RealSystem iQ now supports more than 55 data types and over 20 operating systems. This approach provides RealNetworks with a strong and unique competitive advantage and allows us to provide a wide range of solutions for customers and partners. 
Doc1958,realnetworks ,2001," In June, we unveiled RealSystem Media Commerce Suite (MCS), the industry??s most complete and flexible commerce solution available for the secure licensing and delivery of digital media. MCS helps protect against piracy while enabling a range of business models and gives major content companies the confidence to bring their assets online. A leading example of an MCS customer is the MusicNet service that we, Bertelsmann, Virgin Holdings (EMI), and AOL Time Warner brought to market last fall. "
Doc1959,realnetworks ,2001," Additionally, early in 2002, we announced RealSystem Mobile   a suite of products built on RealSystem to enable mobile networks to deliver audio and video to mobile consumers. We also announced a deep strategic alliance with Nokia through which the RealOne Player will become the standard media player on Nokia??s multimedia handsets for the new advanced 2.5 and 3G wireless networks. Our relationships with Nokia and other partners such as Texas Instruments, Hitachi and Symbian will help us get our technology onto phones and into leading wireless networks worldwide. "
Doc1960,realnetworks ,2001," We also made further headway in 2001 and early 2002 in home environments. We announced RealSystem and RealOne licensing and distribution agreements with Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation?? 2 video game system, Hewlett- Packard for their Digital Entertainment Center, and TiVo for their personal video recorder. "
Doc1961,realnetworks ,2001," We accomplished all of the above while redoubling our commitment to prudent cost management and staying focused on our core strategic goals. The end of 2001 marked our 10th consecutive quarter of proforma operating profitability and our 15th quarter of positive pro-forma cash flow. And we ended the year with a strong and healthy balance sheet, with more than $360 million in cash on hand. Most important, our business model of connecting consumers to quality content through end-to-end media delivery remains as vibrant and powerful as ever. "
Doc1962,realnetworks ,2001," In sum, I am proud of where we are and optimistic about the opportunities in front of us. All measures point to strong growth in audio and video consumer usage and creation worldwide in the coming years. RealNetworks is at the center of this growth and evolution of the digital media market. No other company is bringing together all the pieces to enable this industry to go to the next level. We will continue to use our unique position and dedicated focus to transform consumers?? experience of media. "
Doc1963,realnetworks ,2001," I want to thank our dedicated employees, hundreds of partners, millions of consumers around the world and you, our shareholders, for the ongoing support and confidence in the long-term future of our company. We will continue to work tirelessly in driving our business forward, all the while remaining profoundly optimistic about the limitless opportunities ahead of us. "
Doc1964,realnetworks ,2002,"Two thousand and two was a very important transition year for RealNetworks. In 2002 we implemented several important strategic initiatives that I believe position us well for the years to come. Most notably, we: "
Doc1965,realnetworks ,2002," Nearly doubled our base of retained premium content subscribers from 500,000 to over 900,000, becoming the largest premium media subscription service on the Internet; "
Doc1966,realnetworks ,2002," Transformed our systems software platform business from a traditional proprietary model to a hybrid model built on an open source foundation called Helix, and released the source code for our core Helix DNA platform to a worldwide developer community that already totals over 10,000 members; and "
Doc1967,realnetworks ,2002," Delivered a series of highly differentiated products on top of the Helix DNA platform, including the RealOne Mobile Player for emerging platforms such as Nokia mobile phones, and the industry??s first ??Universal?? media delivery and playback products  the Helix Universal Server and the RealOne Player for PCs. "
Doc1968,realnetworks ,2002, Let me go into each of these areas in more detail. 
Doc1969,realnetworks ,2002," Our push into the content subscription services continued to pay off in 2002 and points the way to a promising future. Over the course of the year, we nearly doubled our retained subscribers from 500,000 to 900,000. RealNetworks provides the top premium media online subscription service on the Internet and, we believe, the fastest growing such service in history. "
Doc1970,realnetworks ,2002," During the year, we aggressively built our subscription services  adding new content providers, expanding content with existing partners, and offering more standalone subscriptions with and for our partners. As an example, in 2002 we started a very successful subscription service with NASCAR.com, a Turner Sports property, to bring consumers closer to the road action for racing. Consumers can purchase this content as part of RealOne or directly from the NASCAR.com site. As RealOne SuperPass and our subscription services gained steam throughout the year, we also significantly expanded the programming offerings with existing content partners such as CBS, Major League Baseball, Fox Sports, and the NBA. Services such as MLB??s offering of condensed games, which enables fans to watch all the hits, plays and runs of a baseball game on-demand in about 20 minutes, show the creative thinking that we and our partners are putting into service programming for our customers. "
Doc1971,realnetworks ,2002," In 2003, we will continue to make significant investments in our content and music subscription businesses to broaden both the content offerings and the audience we reach. RealNetworks is in the unique position of having the most mature aggregated media subscription business backed up by our world-class technology and the ability to reach millions of consumers through our consumer media players and websites. While we do see competition  which is something we anticipated from the beginning  we believe that our advantages in consumer software reach, systems infrastructure, depth of content relationships and consumer technology position RealOne for long-term success. "
Doc1972,realnetworks ,2002," Turning to our software and technology businesses, in 2002 we made a series of moves that I believe will position both our technology platform and the business built on top of it for long-term success. In July, we introduced Helix, a three-pronged approach to transforming the digital media software world. The three key elements underlying Helix are: "
Doc1973,realnetworks ,2002," Helix DNA  the industry??s first major open source core digital media system, which enables developers to work directly with Helix source code and modify it as they see fit to deliver the best digital audio and video products and services in the world. "
Doc1974,realnetworks ,2002, Helix Community  a community of developers empowered to enhance and build on the Helix DNA platform. 
Doc1975,realnetworks ,2002," RealNetworks?? own commercial products built on top of Helix DNA  including RealOne Mobile Players for the Palm and Nokia platforms, and Helix Universal Server and RealOne Players for the PC, which together offer the industry universal delivery and playback of all the major content formats. "
Doc1976,realnetworks ,2002," Over the last five years, the tremendous growth of open and community source platforms such as Linux and Java has established a new model for successful market leadership. Helix builds on this emerging and compelling model. Indeed, we offer two choices for developers - an open source license model, such as the one used by Linux, and a community license model, akin to Java??s, that enables commercial software companies to build their own proprietary enhancements on top of our core technology. "
Doc1977,realnetworks ,2002," With more than 10,000 developers and registered users in the Helix Community a mere six months after we launched it, we believe that Helix is off to a good start. Our goal is to make Helix the leading open platform for digital media delivery, and to fundamentally alter the playing field in the digital media industry in a way that benefits RealNetworks. "
Doc1978,realnetworks ,2002," In terms of the software product businesses we??re building on top of Helix, two themes are emerging  our products will be strongly differentiated by their universal capabilities and embrace of standards, and we will make our products available for a broad range of high volume platforms. "
Doc1979,realnetworks ,2002," The Helix Universal Server and RealOne Player for the PC are both highly differentiated, compelling products. Each is the only major product in its category to offer Universal capabilities  the ability to deliver and play content in all of the major industry formats. During 2002, our RealOne Player was named ??Editor??s Choice?? by PC Magazine and the Helix Universal Server was named Streaming Magazine??s ??Reader??s Choice?? for Best New Software Product of 2002. Each has been adopted by many customers in the market. Since we introduced the RealOne Player in December 2001, over 38 million unique registered users have installed and used the product. In less than a year since the release of the Helix Universal Server in July 2002, a number of major customers have deployed it including AOL, Yahoo, and Boeing. "
Doc1980,realnetworks ,2002," Moving beyond the PC will become increasingly important to our business over time. By 2005, non-PC devices able to connect to the Internet are forecast to outnumber PCs by a margin of four to one, which represents a great opportunity for Helix DNA and the RealOne Player. We already have deep agreements with the world??s leading handset manufacturer, Nokia, the leading PDA company, Palm, the leading consumer electronics brand, Sony, and the leading mobile infrastructure company, Ericsson. The initial fruits of these efforts are shipping in the marketplace  the RealOne Player is the standard media player for the Nokia 3650, 7650, 9210, 9210i and 9290 models, and is now also available for the Palm Tungsten-T. RealOne Player is the only major media player available for all three mobile device platforms: Palm, Pocket PC and Symbian. We will continue to expand the reach of RealNetworks beyond the PC into living rooms, PDAs, and mobile phones. "
Doc1981,realnetworks ,2002," Finally, I want to address the underlying environment we??re operating in. The IT capital-spending environment continues to be sluggish overall. Our overall financial results for 2002 in part reflect the impact of this environment  our top line revenue in 2002 was flat compared to last year and we did not achieve the bottom line goals we set for ourselves going into 2002. "
Doc1982,realnetworks ,2002," On the other hand, several key business drivers  the growth of broadband in home and work, the development of more and more compelling devices capable of playing digital audio and video, better quality content becoming available, and consumers that are increasingly habituated to seek their information and entertainment online  point to increasing business opportunity and growth over the coming years for our products and services. These drivers should create a favorable long-term environment for RealNetworks?? products and services. "
Doc1983,realnetworks ,2002," I believe that our continued innovation in technology and content services combined with these business drivers position RealNetworks to capitalize on the market opportunities ahead of us. It is our strategic goal to lead the market in network-delivered digital audio and video services, and we believe we will achieve this goal in a way that delivers growth in revenue and profitability. "
Doc1984,realnetworks ,2002," I want to thank our dedicated employees, hundreds of partners, millions of consumers around the world and you, our shareholders, for the ongoing support and confidence in the long-term future of our company. We look forward to a successful 2003. "
Doc1985,realnetworks ,2003,"In 2003, RealNetworks turned the corner and resumed being a growth company. Specifically, our annual revenue grew by 11% over 2002, and we set the stage for what we believe will be even faster growth in 2004 as well as a return to operating profitability by the end of the year (excluding the costs of our Microsoft litigation, which I will discuss a bit later). Driving this growth has been our focus on digital consumer services backed by our innovative and groundbreaking technology. Most notably in 2003, we: "
Doc1986,realnetworks ,2003," Grew our consumer revenue by 27% over 2002. Leading the way was our consumer subscription services. Our overall base of subscribers hit 1.3 million paying subscribers at year end, up 44% from the prior year; "
Doc1987,realnetworks ,2003," Made a carefully considered and bold investment in the digital music market with the purchase of Listen.com and the Rhapsody music subscription service. We ended the year as #1 in the online music subscription category with more than 350,000 music subscribers; "
Doc1988,realnetworks ,2003, Expanded our leadership position in the emerging downloadable games market and set the RealArcade games business up for further expansion and success in 2004. Revenue from our games business grew 56% in 2003; and 
Doc1989,realnetworks ,2003," Won crucial mobile accounts for increasing the reach of our mobile media delivery technologies and services around the globe. More than 40 carriers worldwide including the largest carrier in the world,Vodafone, have chosen our Helix mobile platform. "
Doc1990,realnetworks ,2003," During 2003, we continued to transform our business to focus on consumer services based on the power of our distribution and technology platform. In the last quarter of 2003, consumer-based revenue represented 76% of our revenue (and 71% for the year). "
Doc1991,realnetworks ,2003," Real pioneered paid consumer media delivered over the Internet beginning in 2000 and we??ve obtained significant knowledge and expertise in successfully building consumer subscription services that will help us expand and grow these services. Over the past three years we have seen substantial growth in broadband and encouraging progress in consumer devices that enhance IP-delivered media, both of which laid the foundation for the market to develop. "
Doc1992,realnetworks ,2003," While we continued to invest in our video subscription services in 2003, we judged that 2003 was the year when legal, paid digital music and downloadable games services over the Internet would cross into the mainstream. The main reason for this change was  and is  broad availability of licensable content, which was a key missing piece of the equation. This allows our innovation in music products and services to shine through to consumers. Accordingly, we decided to deepen our focus on those categories, by both scaling up our internal efforts and making acquisitions. "
Doc1993,realnetworks ,2003," Digital Music Real??s strategy to win in music is to offer the best and most comprehensive set of offerings in the market. Specifically, today we offer a combination of subscription Internet radio and subscription on-demand services that provide consumers with unlimited on-demand listening to over 625,000 songs at a fixed low price, inexpensive single song purchases, and a universal media player that plays music in every major format and from every major web music store. This strategy paid off in 2003  our music business, including subscriptions, premium radio and individual song sales, grew dramatically, particularly in the second half of the year, which included the results of our Listen.com acquisition. In the fourth quarter of 2003 our music revenue was $7.9 million, up 71% from $4.7 million in the third quarter. "
Doc1994,realnetworks ,2003," On the music subscription front, in August 2003 Real acquired Listen.com. The Listen.com team grew the award-winning Rhapsody music subscription service over five years, and invested more than $100 million to build their business. Since we closed that transaction in August, the Rhapsody service has continued to gain subscribers and grow usage every month. At the close of 2003, we had more than 350,000 paying music subscribers including both Rhapsody and premium radio subscribers  representing growth of 40% since the end of the third quarter and more than 100% since the end of the second quarter. The growth continues  in April 2004, we announced that we had over 450,000 paying music subscribers. Usage of the Rhapsody service continued to grow at an impressive rate reaching more than 56 million songs streamed in March 2004, up 350% from July 2003. By all independent reckonings we have seen, these figures place us #1, well ahead of all other on-demand Internet music subscription services. "
Doc1995,realnetworks ,2003," Our next step in music services is to continue to extend Rhapsody??s more than 45,000 albums into the living room. Through joint work with Intel, there are several devices already shipping that make Rhapsody available in living rooms across the country. We expect to see more devices enabling this secure transfer of music within the home in 2004. "
Doc1996,realnetworks ,2003," Downloadable Games The second category we identified as being ready for prime time in 2003 is downloadable PC games. While this category gets less attention than either the music or console video game categories, it has become a success and Real has become the market leader. "
Doc1997,realnetworks ,2003," RealArcade is a consumer software application that provides all the tools for easy management and playing of casual computer games. Integrated into RealArcade is our catalog of more than 200 downloadable games and more than 60 web games from over 80 different game publishers. In less than two and a half years we have sold over two million downloadable games through the RealArcade platform. In 2003, the RealArcade business, including advertising and subscriptions, grew 56% percent to $12.2 million, up from $7.8 million in 2002. Early in 2004, we acquired GameHouse, a leading developer of downloadable games  a purchase that should set our games business up for continued growth in 2004 and beyond. "
Doc1998,realnetworks ,2003," Consumer Products and Services While music and games have been areas of particular focus for us, we have also been working to enhance a broad range of our consumer products and service offerings in other areas. The best place to see the progress we??re making is RealPlayer 10, released early in 2004. With RealPlayer 10, we??ve added important new features enabling consumers to pause and rewind their video streams, added a great search service and completely rebuilt and enhanced the Real Guide within RealPlayer 10. "
Doc1999,realnetworks ,2003," We are working with the movie and video content industries to help them open up their content libraries to enable comprehensive video services analogous to the ones we now offer in music and downloadable games. We encourage these industries to move forward quickly so they can avoid the ??napsterization?? problem that has hurt the music industry so badly. While we do not know when these libraries will open up, we are positioning our business to be ready when this happens. "
Doc2000,realnetworks ,2003," Technology Business While our consumer business took the limelight in 2003, we also undertook three fundamental initiatives to transform our technology business and to set it up for future growth: (1) leveraging our platform and consumer services expertise to establish a beachhead in the emerging mobile media delivery market; (2) working with the leading technology companies to develop applications and solutions based on our open source Helix media delivery platform; and (3) building new partnerships to extend our Helix platform to new market segments. "
Doc2001,realnetworks ,2003," Though new revenue streams from our mobile business and other new technology initiatives aren??t yet consistently outstripping the decline in revenue from expiring contracts and past sales in our traditional wireline PC technology business, these initiatives are important to position RealNetworks for future success in this historically high gross margin business. "
Doc2002,realnetworks ,2003," We made good progress in 2003 in developing significant new relationships in several markets, driving market penetration of our Helix platform, and laying a solid foundation in the emerging mobile media delivery market. Examples include: "
Doc2003,realnetworks ,2003," Palm has delivered millions of Helix-based RealOne Players in its Zire and Tungston product lines, including the world class Treo 600 phone. "
Doc2004,realnetworks ,2003," RealNetworks has aligned with five of the top six mobile phone manufacturers in the world  Nokia, Motorola, Sony Ericson, Samsung and Siemens  with each manufacturer shipping multimedia phones that include the RealOne Player. The Zelos Group estimates that there will be 20 million phones shipped in 2004 with our media player products. "
Doc2005,realnetworks ,2003," Vodafone, the world??s largest mobile phone company with over 130 million customers worldwide, announced in July a broad-based strategic agreement with RealNetworks to base its mobile media services on the Helix Universal Mobile Server. Operators worldwide have followed suit and more than 30 carriers have adopted the Helix mobile platform. "
Doc2006,realnetworks ,2003," We continued to scale up the services we offer mobile subscribers as well. In 2003, we launched two mobile media consumer services, RealOne for Sprint PCS and RealOne for AT&T mMode. Featuring content from top brands such as ABC News, CBS MarketWatch, NPR, FOX Sports, Sporting News Radio and The Weather Channel, these services deliver content to consumers over their mobile phones. "
Doc2007,realnetworks ,2003," We believe that by continuing to execute on our fundamental technology initiatives outlined above, we can stabilize our technology business in 2004 and set it up for future growth as these new initiatives scale up. "
Doc2008,realnetworks ,2003, Key business drivers continued to progress in 2003. These include: the growth of broadband in home and work; the development of more and more compelling devices capable of playing digital audio and video; availability of high quality content; and consumers who are increasingly accustomed to seeking their information and entertainment online. These drivers should create a positive longterm environment for RealNetworks?? products and services. 
Doc2009,realnetworks ,2003," A brief word about the antitrust litigation we filed against Microsoft Corporation. In December 2003, the RealNetworks Board of Directors and senior management made a carefully considered decision to move ahead with an antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft. We believe that the merits of our case are extremely strong and that the funds spent pursuing this litigation will be money well spent. The recent European Commission ruling against Microsoft regarding its media player bundling practices reinforces this view. Rest assured that we have a small, world-class team working on this case, while the rest of the company continues to focus on doing what we do best, building compelling products and services. Our seven consecutive quarters of revenue growth, including the first quarter of 2004, demonstrate our ability to maintain focus on the future. "
Doc2010,realnetworks ,2003, In 2004 we expect to capitalize on the positive market trends and business strategies to continue to grow our business and to return to profitability in the second half of 2004 (excluding our antitrust litigation expenses). 
Doc2011,realnetworks ,2003," I want to thank our dedicated employees, hundreds of partners, millions of consumers around the world and you, our shareholders, for the ongoing support and confidence in the long-term future of RealNetworks. We look forward to a successful 2004. "
Doc2012,sap ,1997,"In 1997, SAP celebrated the 25th anniversary of its founding, and we received many messages congratulating us on this milestone, and extending best wishes for the continued success of the company. I would like to express my thanks to everyone for these sentiments. "
Doc2013,sap ,1997," SAP had a great year in 1997. Our efforts to expand the company??s global position continued in the year. As a result, the share of total sales outside Germany increased to 81%. SAP is now represented in more than 40 countries by wholly owned subsidiaries or branch offices, and SAP products are used in more than 90 countries which produce roughly 98% of the world??s economic output. According to the findings of a study conducted by IDC, a market research company, SAP has a market share of more than 28%, making it larger than its next five competitors combined. In Europe, we dominate the market for integrated enterprise software, with IDC estimating that SAP has achieved a European market share of 41%. With our strategic position so strong, and supported by our own marketing, service, and support network, we are seeking not just to consolidate our market and technology leadership, but to grow it. "
Doc2014,sap ,1997," We are also continuing to widen our global presence on the world??s equity markets: In the third quarter of 1998, SAP will list on the world??s largest stock market, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). We are taking this step to broaden our shareholder base and significantly enhance our company??s image. "
Doc2015,sap ,1997," The vigorous growth in sales in the 1997 fiscal year  an increase of 62%  is based on the steady global demand for standardized application software to support business processes. Our focus on tailoring our products to customer requirements and our proven ability to supply a steady stream of new, innovative products have stimulated the growing interest in SAP software worldwide and paced its sales strength among companies of all sizes. The challenge of the new millennium and the introduction of the euro have given an extra surge to demand. "
Doc2016,sap ,1997," We achieved the targets we set for 1997, and set new standards of quality in our products and services. At the same time, we dramatically shortened implementation times for the R/3 System with the aid of new concepts, methods, and tools. "
Doc2017,sap ,1997," The on-time shipment of the new Release 4.0 of the R/3 System is yet further evidence of the capabilities of our workforce. With this new version we have implemented our vision of progressively evolving the R/3 System into a portfolio of independent software components. The key innovations of Release 4.0 include functional enhancements along the entire value chain, the separation of the main Human Resources component from the core areas of Logistics and Financials, additional Internet applications, and new industry solutions  including those for retailing and the public sector. "
Doc2018,sap ,1997," We have once again set ourselves ambitious goals for 1998. Foremost is to strengthen our role as the world leader in client/server application software, and thus to continue our impressive financial performance. A central theme of our software development plans will be the implementation of the Industry Business Unit (IBU) structure. This new organizational approach is an integral step in SAP??s development into a vendor of turnkey solutions for enterprises operating in a variety of industries. "
Doc2019,sap ,1997," Over many years I have said that SAP??s success is inseparable from our unique corporate culture, as well as our ability to recognize and adapt to change. I have always been wary of getting stuck in familiar ways of thinking where yesterday??s good ideas turn into today??s and tomorrow??s rigid strictures and dogma. When this happens, the urge to seek out and adopt unconventional solutions may be inhibited. At SAP, we do not want this to happen. "
Doc2020,sap ,1997," My colleague and co-founder on the Executive Board, Dr. h. c. Klaus Tschira, and I have therefore decided to leave our positions on SAP??s Executive Board and gain election to the Supervisory Board: I will seek to become chairman of the Supervisory Board. By doing so we want to place our experience and knowledge at SAP??s disposal. "
Doc2021,sap ,1997," In addition to my Supervisory Board tasks, my intention is to serve the Executive Board by providing advice and council as necessary. One of my primary goals will be to strengthen our corporate culture. Much of my future efforts and commitment will continue to be focused on SAP. Like my co-founders, I view this company as my life??s work to which I owe a great deal and to which I will always feel closely linked. "
Doc2022,sap ,1997," I wish every success to Prof. Dr. Henning Kagermann, who will succeed me as co-chairman of the Executive Board. I greatly respect and admire Dr. Kagermann??s personal qualities, technical knowledge, and managerial skills. "
Doc2023,sap ,1997, I would like to thank all of those who have placed their trust and confidence in SAP and its products. I look forward to its continued success. 
Doc2024,sap ,1998,"This year??s Annual Report is more than just an account of another successful year in SAP??s 26 years of thriving business. We hope it will provide you with insight into the variety of environments in which our customers use our products, and the benefits they  and in turn their customers  derive from them. SAP??s recipe for success includes more than good business results: The quality and variety of our products and the innovative spirit of our employees are essential ingredients. Our ambition is to help everyone who uses our products gain more satisfaction from their work and from the results of their work. A strict orientation to the needs of our customers is our incentive. Future development will be driven not by what is technically achievable, but by what will benefit our customers. The EnjoySAP initiative channels all our efforts toward this goal. EnjoySAP is much more than a regular product development project: It expresses the vision and culture of SAP as a company. "
Doc2025,sap ,1998," We reached some important milestones this year: SAP co-founders Dietmar Hopp and Klaus Tschira became Supervisory Board members, signaling a new phase for the company. SAP??s debut on Wall Street was the biggest new listing in the history of the New York Stock Exchange. Quotation on the NYSE was a natural step for us as a global organization. "
Doc2026,sap ,1998," One of our most significant accomplishments in fiscal 1998 was the recruitment of nearly 6,500 highly qualified new employees worldwide. This sizeable investment creates the right conditions for our continued success, enabling us to reach out to new customers and offer existing customers new products. We needed efficient human resources management to manage recruitment on that scale: We are developing Advanced HR, a software platform for optimizing differentiated utilization of all resources, for our own use and soon for the benefit of our customers. In the past we??ve demonstrated our speed and reliability in responding to customer and market issues like the euro changeover and year 2000. Our job now is to exploit our lead with new initiatives and developments. "
Doc2027,sap ,1998," Global business conditions were challenging in 1998 and we??re pleased to have met our target sales revenue growth of 40%. We also increased profit before taxes and before creation of STAR program accruals by 18%, although this was short of our target. This shortfall was caused by unanticipated sales delays in Japan at the end of the 1998 fiscal year. These challenges notwithstanding, we again grew our share of the big five competitors?? market by 2% to just under 60%. In fact, SAP??s software sales revenues are four times greater than the software sales revenues of all four biggest competitors combined. According to a study by Gartner Group, a noted U.S. market researcher in the field of information technology, SAP is the only Enterprise Resource Planning software vendor with both a complete vision of new software solutions as well as the ability to execute them. Industry Business Units and Solution Maps of complete business processes support our successful orientation toward industry sectors. We are expanding our indirect marketing to small and medium-sized enterprises  in the Value Added Resellers field alone we doubled our installed base during 1998. "
Doc2028,sap ,1998," New Dimensions is the initiative behind our drive to become a multi-product vendor. We anticipate that in five years or less, Supply Chain Management, Customer Relationship Management, and Business Intelligence will account for a third of SAP??s sales revenues. In 1999 we will be able to achieve greater profitability by focusing more on expenses, particularly the cost of buying services, and by improving the efficiency of our sales, marketing, and development operations. Our productivity will receive an extra boost with new employees ??going live?? in 1999. Our target for sales revenue growth this year is 20% to 25%, and we aim to double sales over the coming three years. This will strengthen our position as market leader. "
Doc2029,sap ,1998, Thank you all for your continued confidence in SAP??s business and technological vision. We look forward to achieving sustained success together. 
Doc2030,sap ,1999,"In 1999, SAP once again grew to meet bigger challenges and mastered difficult situations successfully. Nearly all providers of enterprise software suffered a negative impact from the millennium change in 1999, after having profited from a year-2000-driven boost in demand in the previous few years. SAP??s customers prepared to pass the critical date change with as little disturbance as possible. Many therefore delayed decisions to implement new enterprise software. "
Doc2031,sap ,1999," Parallel to the relatively subdued developments in our markets, there was a sea of change in our core business in the space of a few months. To succeed in the market of the future, enterprise software must not just be Internet-enabled, which SAP R/3 has been since 1996, it must access the new opportunities offered to enterprises by e-business. It was in our chief market, the United States, that it first became clear that the Internet was dramatically changing business-to-business trading, that is, the business processes between enterprises. "
Doc2032,sap ,1999," With the double challenge of year-2000 issues and the Internet revolution, it is especially pleasing that SAP again increased its market lead in 1999. By the end of the year, there were more than 25,000 system and product installations worldwide. Revenues and income before income taxes (excluding expenses for the employee STAR program) grew by 18 %. "
Doc2033,sap ,1999," The speed and scale of the change to the Internet age surprised us, but we responded more quickly than our competitors, and totally reoriented SAP??s business. Today the Internet is at the focus of all our initiatives and developments. As of 1999, SAP has become the number one supplier of end-to-end inter-enterprise solutions for collaborative business processes. "
Doc2034,sap ,1999," The efforts of SAP??s employees deserve special mention. It was their skills and dedication that enabled us not just to announce the redefinition of SAP in 1999, but also to deliver on that redefinition in the same year. SAP reworked its entire product offering and successfully introduced mySAP.com, a completely Internetoriented, open software and service solution. Announced in May 1999, we supplied the first customers in September 1999. "
Doc2035,sap ,1999," Employees of our customers using mySAP.com have new ways to take ownership of their work and working environment. At the enterprise level, SAP is giving its customers access to new added value and company growth, plus completely new business models. mySAP.com has struck a very positive note with customers and was already making a very substantial 16% contribution to sales revenues in our successful fourth quarter. In the final weeks of the year, we won over several prestigious partners to build and run Internet marketplaces  the trading centers of the future. In 1999, SAP also managed to consolidate or build on its position as a strategic partner in several sectors, among others in the area served by our banking solution. "
Doc2036,sap ,1999," This permanent realignment of SAP as an Internet business was also reflected in a reallocation of responsibilities on the Executive Board. Now these are no longer geographically defined; instead, responsibilities are oriented to the Internet strategy and the worldwide solutions offering. "
Doc2037,sap ,1999," To secure and build on its success in this age of the Internet, SAP again invested massively in highly qualified new employees in 1999. The number of employees rose 12 % to approximately 21,700. Very many of the employees participate in the success of our enterprise, measured by the rising share price, through the STAR program. SAP??s attractiveness as an employer in the highly competitive market for IT specialists grew at the end of 1999 with the inception of the SAP AG 2000 Long Term Incentive Plan, which offers stock options and convertible bonds. "
Doc2038,sap ,1999," SAP??s mid- to long-term success as an Internet company depends heavily on intensifying research and development still further. One in four of our employees are now working on developing new solutions or improving existing ones. In 1999, we continued to decentralize development and bring it closer to our customers. A quarter of our R&D employees currently work at our SAP Labs outside Germany, be it in Silicon Valley or France, India or Japan. The focal points of development in 1999 and the current year include EnjoySAP  making SAP solutions easier to use  and the business solutions and many e-business applications for mySAP.com. "
Doc2039,sap ,1999, Prestigious investment bankers Goldman Sachs see mySAP.com as a good strategy for SAP to extend its leadership in the enterprise software market into the promising market for business-to-business and e-business solutions. One route to benefiting from the growth opportunities is that the mySAP.com Workplace could increase the proportion of SAP users in a typical enterprise from today??s approximately 15 % to as much as 80 %. We are also busy increasing our potential market with outsourcing offerings for midsize enterprises. 
Doc2040,sap ,1999," The Executive Board stands by its prediction that within three years the Company can approximately double its 1998 revenue. We anticipate that product revenues will grow more than service revenues in 2000, which would further improve our profitability. Software revenue growth from mySAP.com should be particularly vigorous this year. We believe new product sales will account for about 50 % of software license revenue. We expect especially strong growth in the United States and Asia. "
Doc2041,sap ,1999, We hope you will accompany us along this road. Thank you for your continued interest and confidence in SAP. 
Doc2042,sap ,2000,"The millennium changeover really brought home to everyone just how much our daily lives depend on robust and reliable software. And it was no accident that the troubles many people feared did not materialize for SAP customers. With our leading consulting services, top-quality products, and highly skilled employees, we were in a position to ensure a good start to 2000 for all of our customers. "
Doc2043,sap ,2000," Naturally, the millennium issue also influenced the buying behavior of our customers. For example, 1999 showed a disproportionately high demand for consulting, which decreased dramatically thereafter. Hence, in the first quarter of 2000, we did not need the consulting force that was in place for emergencies. While this was fortunate for our customers, it was less fortunate for SAP, as we incurred a major expense during a customarily slow quarter for software sales. "
Doc2044,sap ,2000," Throughout each of the quarters in 2000, the share of our revenues generated by the new mySAP.com e-business platform grew. However, in the early quarters, revenue development caused some unease about the outlook for our new product. "
Doc2045,sap ,2000," Other market factors also affected SAP in early 2000. The dot-com euphoria captured the attention of customers and employees alike. The New Economy was on everyone??s minds  an economy with a completely different set of business rules. In addition, the use of stock options both to reward employees and to buy customer references led to unusual distortions in market forces. This particularly affected our employee turnover in the U.S. With our shareholders?? approval, we launched our own stock option plan, which helped to retain management resources. "
Doc2046,sap ,2000," Even with these challenges, SAP moved forward successfully on all fronts to change itself from a vendor of components to a provider of solutions, a journey that started with the enjoySAP initiative. As part of SAP??s reinforced customer orientation, we introduced a new, comprehensive Customer Engagement Model for field operations. We also aligned our R&D teams more closely with the sales and consulting forces, so that all three are now focused even more closely on the issues at the heart of our customers?? business. "
Doc2047,sap ,2000," What are customers looking for At the top of customers?? list is the ability to leverage new e-business technologies to improve old-fashioned goals like profitability, customer satisfaction, and delivering the goods. Customers want solutions that help them better manage their customer relationships and their supply chains. Marketplaces and portals are their other key focus areas. "
Doc2048,sap ,2000," Electronic marketplaces can connect separate software and hardware systems in a way that lets people and companies work together in every possible kind of business. Here the electronic processes flow smoothly from partner to partner as if there were no boundaries between companies. A portal like mySAP Workplace is a convenient, secure access point to all of the information, services and applications that people need to do their job. "
Doc2049,sap ,2000," In 2000, SAP established SAPMarkets, a wholly owned subsidiary based in Palo Alto, Calif., to provide electronic marketplace solutions to customers. By forging a strategic partnership with Commerce One, SAP solidified its leading position in this new market and gained immediate access to new business opportunities. SAP has also achieved more flexibility by establishing two other new affiliates: SAPHosting AG & Co., an ASP and hosting provider and SAP Systems Integration AG, a largely independent company devoted to systems integration. "
Doc2050,sap ,2000, We have also globalized SAP??s marketing and have centered the operation in New York. The goals of this move are to tighten the ties with our subsidiaries to present a more unified and consistent view of SAP to the world and to sharpen our corporate profile and corporate communications. 
Doc2051,sap ,2000," These measures, as well as the successful reorganization of a number of country organizations, came to fruition in 2000. The Americas SAPPHIRE customer conference in Las Vegas not only won over customers and partners, it also convinced the media and analysts that we are on the right track and gaining momentum. At the conference, we announced our biggest deal ever, which we closed with Nestle for the mySAP.com e-business platform, and our alliance with Commerce One. By the fourth quarter, the numbers we posted were already better than our expectations  testament to a year spent winning back the confidence of our customers and providing the most comprehensive ebusiness solutions available anywhere. "
Doc2052,sap ,2000," So, after a turbulent and challenging year, we are in a strong position and we look forward to the future with great confidence. We thank you for your support thus far and encourage you to stay with us as our exciting success story continues to unfold. "
Doc2053,sap ,2001,"No one could have thought at the beginning of 2001 that we would be faced with the terrible events of September 11 and the resulting worldwide consequences. What we could see coming, however, was the slowing of the economy, which began in the U.S. and worked its way around the world. Nothing seemed to be able to stop this recessionary atmosphere, neither growth in Europe nor in Asia. While our competitors in the business software market were dealing with, in some cases, dramatic reductions in sales and the related loss of market share, SAP?? demonstrated that it is a long-term, reliable business partner for our customers. And we have a strong market share in all relevant business arenas. "
Doc2054,sap ,2001," During the past year, we were able to strengthen our relationships with existing customers and also gain new customers, which made up almost a third of our business. This confirms that the business model we have sustained during our now thirty years of doing business is robust and flexible. And the strong, sustained interest in our modern e-business solution, mySAP.com??, demonstrates how important this is, especially in terms of new customers. Within the context of this challenging business environment, SAP was able to confirm its leadership position with a 17% increase in sales. "
Doc2055,sap ,2001," For the first half of 2002, we do not foresee any major change in the market conditions, but do expect demand to increase significantly by the end of the year. "
Doc2056,sap ,2001," The last several years have seen SAP position itself as a worldwide leader in the market of e-business solutions. By defining the new, New Economy at the high point of the dot-com bubble, we pushed for a return to the true, timeless values of successful business: efficiency, customer satisfaction, and profitability. Today, SAP solutions play an important role in helping companies increase efficiency. "
Doc2057,sap ,2001," With our strategic initiatives in the areas of customer relationship management (CRM), supply chain management (SCM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), and exchanges and portals, SAP continues to invest in technologies that protect our customers?? software investments and ensure the success of a ??best-run business.?? "
Doc2058,sap ,2001," In our modern world of doing business, complexity is growing and this is reflected in the corresponding complexity of a company??s IT landscape. Our customers, therefore, need effective support from us for dealing with these ever-increasing IT needs. "
Doc2059,sap ,2001," The big topic this year is open, integrated platforms. Openness is required because no software provider can meet every need of every customer with one suite of solutions. This means that, in the best interest of our customers, solutions from partners and even competitors must be able to be integrated. And here we mean integrating business processes across product, system, and enterprise boundaries. This goes far beyond just connecting the data; it requires a full understanding of the underlying business processes to effectively connect the systems. "
Doc2060,sap ,2001, SAP is a leader in this area and has been a global driver of these technologies and the open standards and transparent interfaces they require. 
Doc2061,sap ,2001," We recognized this fact early on and already offer products that fulfill these requirements and help our customers gain real advantages. For example, our mySAP.com?? e-business platform is based on technologies that support these open standards. Companies can use this foundation to implement and combine all types of applications easily and flexibly  both SAP systems and solutions from other providers. This leaves customers free to use any combination of products, whatever they require that best meets their needs. SAP stands ready with an offering that includes both complete solutions and customerspecific applications. "
Doc2062,sap ,2001," It is important to also note that employees of our customers see the world differently from their IT department. They aren??t interested in knowing which software products were implemented and how they work together. What employees want is individualized access to the information they need for their role in the company, available using an intuitive and personalized user interface. Portals are the best answer to this challenge, which is why we bought one of the leading providers of portal technologies, TopTier, last year. We took their knowledge and resources and combined them with those of our teams dealing with business intelligence, knowledge management, and the workplace. We also added the expert consultants in those areas to this new company. All in all, we have created the leading provider of portals, SAP Portals. "
Doc2063,sap ,2001," SAP also expanded its strategic partnership with Commerce One, the specialist for electronic marketplaces on the Internet. We did this because we recognized that the technical basis for integrating business processes across company boundaries is very close to the technologies needed to run these electronic marketplaces. This is one of the first areas where Web services are used. These are applications that allow a company to integrate other applications across company boundaries. We see Web services as a very important addition to SAP??s solution offering. "
Doc2064,sap ,2001," Along these same lines, we have extended our applications for CRM, SCM, and product lifecycle management (PLM) to support collaboration in heterogeneous IT environments. And because all of these new applications can only be implemented when integrated in a strong back end, it??s no surprise that the traditional ERP market, which SAP already dominates, is marked for growth. "
Doc2065,sap ,2001," Today, SAP is a leader in solutions both for portals and exchanges, and for SCM, PLM, ERP, and important areas of CRM. But our leadership is not only in market share. An important measure of our success is our own requirement that the mySAP.com solutions are of the highest quality and provide our customers with the optimum solution. "
Doc2066,sap ,2001," Our entire business is focused on building and maintaining long-term relationships with our customers. We work closely with our customers because it gives us not only an enormous amount of critical realworld experience, but also a feeling for what the market really wants. This ensures our customers?? investments are safe for the long-term and provides them with a substantial return on investment (ROI). "
Doc2067,sap ,2001," We know that our success during this difficult year was only possible due to the hard work of our global employees and management as well as that of our customers and partners, all working toward a common goal. We??d like to take this opportunity to thank all of them. Our investors were also put to the test this year. We??d like to thank you for your trust in us and hope that you will continue to accompany us on our road to success. "
Doc2068,sap ,2001," We have confirmed our excellent position and the perspectives look very good. We could very well see a repeat of our global success in the early 1990s, back when we wrote the book on ERP software. "
Doc2069,sap ,2002,"the year 2002, with its considerable difficulties, proved to be a challenging one for sap. continued economic uncertainty around the globe, the long-term effects of the terrorist attacks in the united states, and accounting scandals at the beginning of the year greatly influenced consumer and investor behavior. numerous companies had to adapt their planning over and over again. and yet, sap again performed exceedingly well in 2002. in fact, the fourth quarter of 2002 saw sap achieve the best earnings in its 30-year history. "
Doc2070,sap ,2002," the greatest challenge was adjusting to slight or even no revenue growth - instead of the 15% growth originally expected - while increasing profitability. sap has improved overall efficiency in the long term not with massive reductions in staff, but through careful cost-cutting measures and rationalization of our global infrastructure. more intensive customer support, optimized product quality, and research and development spending remaining at the same levels as the previous year show the savings were not to the detriment of our customers. "
Doc2071,sap ,2002, growing market share. sap has proven its ability to adapt effectively and compared to our competitors is now in a better position than ever before. sap's market share is now more than that of our next five largest competitors combined. our overall customer-satisfaction levels have increased in every region and we are outperforming our competitors in this area. 
Doc2072,sap ,2002," customer-focused innovation. sap develops solutions that best meet our customers needs. today's customers require quick return on investment (roi), long-term security, and lower total cost of ownership (tco) from their information technology (it) investments. sap delivered highly innovative products to the market in 2002, leveraging our business and technological expertise. "
Doc2073,sap ,2002," the development of sap netweaver and sap enterprise services architecture are the most significant technological advances since the move from sap r/2 to sap r/3. sap netweaver integrates heterogenerous it systems and brings together business processes, information and users across company boundaries. the possibility of integrating other technologies, such as microsoft.net and ibm websphere ensures flexible it infrastructures. this means that customers can reduce the complexity of their it infrastructures and reduce operating costs in the long term. "
Doc2074,sap ,2002," sap netweaver is the technological basis for sap enterprise services architecture, and enables the design of state-of-the-art, all encompassing solutions for specific business tasks. with this technology, existing applications can be used more effectively and it investments can be protected. building on the sap netweaver platform, we have enhanced nearly all the solutions in my sap business suite (formerly, mysap.com) with new industry-specific functions. in 2002, we also developed the latest releases of mysap customer relationship management, mysap supplier relationship management, and other solutions. "
Doc2075,sap ,2002," during the past year, we further developed a generation of new software solutions that are particularly easy to configure: the new sap cross applications. these solutions are built on our customers' heterogeneous applications, use their datasets and bundle all the functions that the use requires. this facilitates the deployment of new functions by using existing systems and applications. "
Doc2076,sap ,2002," in addition, sap established a new small and midsize business unit as an important step toward opening up an enormous market segment that is experiencing growth worldwide. with sap business one and my sap all-in-on we have positioned sap as a global brand for small and midsize businesses. "
Doc2077,sap ,2002," increased productivity. our solutions are the core element of our customers' business processes. the functional breadth and depth as well as the cost/benefit ratio of our solutions are crucial to the success of our customers. our approach to quality is not limited to software components but extends to the capabilities of the entire solution. by further increasing efficiency, we have succeeded in delivering products of outstanding quality to the market. we have also improved consultiung, service, and support thus enabling us to increase the number of customer systems going live by 8% in 2002. this was achieved without increasing support costs. "
Doc2078,sap ,2002," trusted advisor. by raising the level of quality, sap managed to further increas its role as a trusted advisor, despite customers' limited it budgets. today, over 19300 customers worldwide are not only increasing efficiency with their sap solutions but also trust sap as a strong, strategic partner offering them in-depth knowledge to best address their specific needs. key aspects of being a trusted advisor are reliability and independence, even in a difficult market economy. in 2002, sap succeeded in increasing its profitability and focusing its organization more strongly on market demands. therefore, the company has created a strong foundation for maintaining its independence - now and in the future. "
Doc2079,sap ,2002," the year ahead. the overall economic climate is not likely to experience a strong recovery in 2003. on the contrary, decisions about it spending will continue to be based on the added value it can contribute, and spending is unlikely to increase. however, demand will continue to grow for business application software that optimizes critical business processes and minimizes investment risks. "
Doc2080,sap ,2002," sap used 2002 to adapt to these new customer requirements. our solutions, technology and architecture provide real business value to customers. this year, we will also focus on market issue-specific packaged solutions. these solutions will include predefined combinations of applications and services designed to handle specific business problems. the packaged solutions will minimize implementation risks for customers and offer faster return on investment. "
Doc2081,sap ,2002," overall, we have created the foundation for driving growth and gaining greater market share in 2003. two factors will ensure that sap can remain as stable as possible in an uncertain market. our comprehensive product portfolio with its powerful, integrative technologies, and our flexible optimized infrastructure. in 2003, sap will once again concentrate on efficiently deploying resources, further reducing costs to increase profitability, and strategically investing in research and development so that we can ensure our future growth. "
Doc2082,sap ,2002," business integrity. responsible corporate governance has been a fundamental value at sap since the company was founded. by expanding on its principles of corporate governance in 2003, sap has shown the importance it places on transparent communication. "
Doc2083,sap ,2002," adapting, innovating, winning. sap's corporate culture was essential to our excellent performance in a difficult year. the flexibility and innvoative thinking of our 29000 employees worldwide are what makes sap stand out. we would like to take this opportunity to thank them, our partners, and our customers for their contribution and dedication. "
Doc2084,sap ,2002," we also thank you, our investors, for continuing to believe in sap despite the prevailing uncertainties. we look forward to your continued support. thanks to profitable applications for our customers, an open technology platform, and our investment in the future, sap is well positioned for the years ahead. "
Doc2085,sap ,2003,"At the beginning of 2003, SAP, likemany of our customers, was uncertain about the economic and political situation. Our strategic goals were therefore to significantly improve earnings per share and increase SAP??s market share, despite forecasts of a stagnant market. We executed well on this strategy and, despite the currency impact of a strong euro, were able to exceed guidance by reporting record operating income, earnings per share, andmargin growth. Our gains inmarket share, measured against our four major peers, was also greater than ever before. The SAP share price increased 76% over the year and outperformed the German DAX by 39 percentage points, and the Goldman Sachs Software Index by 26 percentage points. "
Doc2086,sap ,2003," In 2003, business priorities for companies worldwide included pressures for better corporate governance; focus on core business, primarily cost controls, lean operations, and efficiency; and ensuring that customers were at the center of business. Companies sought to increase profitability by running their businesses more effectively, and wanted to ensure that they had the flexibility to exploit the new opportunities that an economic recovery would create. Technology was considered crucial to achieving these business goals. However, information technology (IT) investments needed tomake a faster return than in the past and so this aspect was closely monitored in all projects. Companies were looking for, and will continue to look for, technology solutions to solve real business problems  gone are the days of technology for technology??s sake. Decision-makers thus preferred manageable, lower risk projects with a swifter return on investment (ROI), which led to an overall decline in deal size, a trend that SAP successfully managed to offset through a 13% increase in the number of deals signed during 2003. "
Doc2087,sap ,2003," Software vendors were under greater pressure to deliver ever-evolving, futureproof solutions to satisfy customers?? more exacting demands. 2003 saw substantial industry consolidation and, in the business software sector, the effects were far-reaching. While SAPmay now face fewer competitors, the competitive landscape has becomemuch more fierce. We experienced unprecedented pricing pressures in 2003 but were able to benefit from good, long-established relationships with customers and our image as a reliable partner. As many of our competitors were looking internally to their own operations and faced self-induced challenges created through mergers and acquisitions, SAP was able to sharpen its focus on meeting customers?? needs. For example, despite the strong currency impact on our license revenues and an overall focus on growing operatingmargin, we increased spending on research and development (R&D) by 9% year-on-year. Our commitment to innovating for our customers was recognized by Wall Street Journal Europe, which gave its European Innovation Award to SAP for our work in radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. "
Doc2088,sap ,2003," We restructured the Company to enable us to resolutely pursue our goals and react flexibly to changes in IT buying patterns. Amanagement transition took place when Hasso Plattner, co-founder and former co-CEO, decided to leave the day-to-day operations of SAP to dedicate his time to the mid- and long-term strategic direction of the Company. This transition was effected smoothly, and the Company continued to execute on the strategy that Hasso and I developed during our five years of shared leadership as co-CEOs of SAP. At the Annual General Shareholders?? Meeting in May, you appointed Hasso to the Supervisory Board and he was immediately named as its Chairperson. "
Doc2089,sap ,2003," 2003 was another difficult year for the software industry, yet SAP continued to strengthen its globalmarket leadership position. Translated into U.S. dollars, the reporting currency of our main competitors, we increased software license revenue 12% while the rest of themarket saw another decrease (3 %). SAP??s worldwide share of themarket against its four largest competitors was 59 % at the end of the fourth quarter of 2003, compared with 51 % at the end of the fourth quarter of 2002. In the United States, we became themarket leader through a 2003 increase inmarket share of 14 %. "
Doc2090,sap ,2003," We also achievedmarket leadership in our major product lines. In particular, we accomplished our goal of becoming the number one customer relationship management vendor globally by offering themarket a superior solution. With mySAP Customer Relationship Management (mySAP CRM), our customers enjoy the benefits of best-of-breed software while also benefiting from the lower total cost of ownership (TCO) offered by an integrated suite of solutions. "
Doc2091,sap ,2003," Our clear message delivered to customers at our annual SAPPHIRE conferences was a call to invest in innovation. We demonstrated that smart IT contributes to a company??s bottom line, providing ROI while reducing total cost of ownership, specifically in times of economic uncertainty. This message has resonated well in themarket and has helped to put SAP back into the number one position. "
Doc2092,sap ,2003," SAP??s corporate culture and our highly motivated employees were essential to our excellent performance. Our 30.000 employees worldwide are known for their flexibility, idealism, and innovative thinking. We would like to take this opportunity to thank them, our partners, and our customers for their contribution and dedication. "
Doc2093,sap ,2003," In 2003, one of SAP??s most significant accomplishments was the launch of Enterprise Services Architecture and SAP NetWeaver technology platform, the technical enabler of this service-oriented architecture for adaptive business solutions. SAP NetWeaver helps companies achieve growth through continuous change and innovation. It allows our customers to integrate existing assets into their SAP landscapes for further ROI and lower TCO. It also helps them to quickly automate new business processes that foster change. And, it provides business and financial transparency by integrating previously ??siloed?? business processes across SAP and non-SAP applications as well as between in-house and outsourced applications. SAP NetWeaver opens up a new dimension: It elevates an existing IT infrastructure from an enabler of work to an enabler of change, andmakes change sustainable through reduced risk and contained cost. "
Doc2094,sap ,2003," In an effort to better align the SAP development organization to deliver on the SAP NetWeaver promise and to continually add customer-oriented innovation to our offerings, SAP undertook its most significant corporate realignment ever during the summer of 2003. The Strategic Cross-Organizational Realignment initiative created business solution groups to increase our focus on developing and delivering tailored industry solutions. We also created the Application Platform& Architecture group to set architectual standards and develop reusable software components. "
Doc2095,sap ,2003," Our success in 2003 is not a one-time, short-term story. SAP does not operate in one-year cycles; our strategy is for the long-term. The overall economic outlook for 2004 is far more optimistic and SAP will focus strongly on increasing license revenue, while also continuing our focus on increasing profitability. We will execute on our strategy of offering an innovative product portfolio that helps customers identify and capitalize on growth opportunities through better business processes. We will continue to invest in business solutions for small and midsize businesses in order to improve our products and their delivery to new market segments. And, we will continue to invest in research and development, develop future growth areas of our business, and drive for market-wide adoption of SAP NetWeaver. "
Doc2096,sap ,2003," SAP has proven that it can outperform the market in both good and bad times. With the strengths highlighted above, our ongoing commitment to our customers?? success, and an overall better economic outlook for the year, SAP expects to benefit more than our competition from the upswing in the economy. Analysts have expressed confidence that SAP will continue to increasemarket share regardless of how quickly overall IT investment recovers, and that the Company will be able to continue to deliver high growth in earnings per share. We agree with this analysis and look forward to sharing our success with you. "
Doc2097,sapiens ,1998,"1998 was a dramatic year for Sapiens with strong financial performance and major advances in broadening our solutions portfolio. These new solution initiatives have opened exciting new growth opportunities for Sapiens. Looking forward, we aim to capitalize on these opportunities by deepening existing customer relationships and expanding our customer base both directly and through global strategic alliances. "
Doc2098,sapiens ,1998," We outperformed our business plan in 1998, with particular success in growing operating profits. Operating income rose 93% to $9.6 million and operating margins widened to 13.6% from 11.2% in 1997. Net income accelerated further in 1998 to $9.7 million or $0.43 per share, up 114% from $0.12 per share in 1997. Revenues for the year reached $71 million, representing a 59% increase from 1997. "
Doc2099,sapiens ,1998," These results do not include any revenue from new solutions launched in 1998, but already by the fourth quarter we received a large majority of new orders for our new solution initiatives. Our turnkey EuroMigrationTM solution has established Sapiens as a leader in the market for the euro currency transition. Our e-commerce solution is a powerful answer for large organizations seeking to integrate e-business with their legacy systems. Our maintenance outsourcing initiative is a cost effective solution to relieve in-house IT departments of the burden of maintaining large scale applications. Our IV&V (independent verification and validation) solution offers independent expert verification of critical Y2K compliance efforts. Our enterprise application integration (EAI) initiative, to be launched toward the end of 1999, will enable all of a customer??s applications to communicate with each other, regardless of different programming standards and protocols. "
Doc2100,sapiens ,1998," To support these growth opportunities, we made a series of acquisitions in 1998. Sapiens acquired SAIC, a leading IT service provider, to meet the growing demand for our solutions in France. In the US, we bought a majority interest in InsureTech Alternatives, an insurance applications consulting firm, to fortify our expertise in the insurance services industry. We also acquired the proprietary rights to ??Component Integrator??, an important technology for our enterprise application integration solution. "
Doc2101,sapiens ,1998," Sapiens?? vision is to anticipate and address the challenges of change that will continue to confront large organizations. Sapiens?? strength is our professional and technological depth, which delivers fast and cost effective solutions to meet these challenges. Sapiens?? future is the virtually unlimited range of opportunities presented by these global challenges, as well as our widening scope of long-term customer relationships and strategic partnerships. "
Doc2102,sapiens ,1998," I want to take this opportunity on behalf of the Board of Directors to thank our dedicated employees at Sapiens whose skills, commitment, and enthusiasm have enabled us to once again exceed our objectives. Your Board of Directors and the entire Sapiens team will continue to work together to remain at the forefront of IT needs and to take advantage of our outstanding growth opportunities. "
Doc2103,sapiens ,1999,1999 proved a pivotal year for Sapiens. We succeeded in outperforming our growth forecasts as we transitioned the Company for the future. 
Doc2104,sapiens ,1999," Annual revenues grew from $71.0 million in 1998 to $91.8 in 1999, an increase of 29%. Operating income increased 37%, from $9.6 million to $13.2 million, excluding a $2.0 million restructuring charge related to the closure of year 2000 activities. On the same basis, operating profit margins increased from 13.6% in 1998 to 14.4% in 1999 and net income increased substantially, from $9.7 million in 1998 to $15.1 million in1999, or $0.43 per share in 1998 to $0.61 per share in 1999, a 42% increase. "
Doc2105,sapiens ,1999," During the year, Sapiens made significant advances by implementing large-scale IT reengineering and euro transition solutions for our global customers. We also leveraged our past successes to position our Company for strategic expansion and stronger growth. The momentum fueled by these combined triumphs propelled the successful launch of Sapiens eMerge??, a family of end-to-end, e-business solution offerings. "
Doc2106,sapiens ,1999," The initial response to the launch has been extremely positive. Soon after the launch in the last quarter of 1999, we implemented several eMerge projects. We can already cite examples of new eMerge-developed applications that have been successfully integrated into our customers?? business. "
Doc2107,sapiens ,1999," Sapiens is at the forefront of the change process that drives today??s global businesses. Our eMerge offerings are fully responsive to the most significant business transition of our time, and address the specific needs of brick-and-mortar and dot-com companies as they move to further establish themselves in e-business. "
Doc2108,sapiens ,1999," New Solutions  The eMerge Family As the year came to a close, we launched our new endto- end, e-business solution, eMerge. We created this new solution from our accumulated expertise, innovative technologies and proven methodologies capabilities that have made Sapiens the preferred provider for innovative, rapid and incremental solutions. The eMerge family of solutions targets both new as well as traditional businesses, and provides solutions unique to their distinctive business requirements. eMerge seamlessly links the established brick-and-mortar??s back-end with a new, Internet-based business model and it helps build the ??brick?? back-end essential for the dot-com??s continued success. "
Doc2109,sapiens ,1999, Sapiens?? eMerge solution is a powerful tool that offers three significant e-business benefits to our customers: the ability to exploit the substantial cost-savings inherent in Internet-based businesses; the nimbleness to rapidly deploy Internet-based applications when speed is paramount; and the flexibility to adapt in response to evolving market conditions. These benefits address the most important and fundamental issues in business today: how to structure and continually refine e-business to tackle the dynamic nature of the Internet age. 
Doc2110,sapiens ,1999," During the year, we also introduced eMerge Insure?? and eMerge Loan?? Sapiens?? e-business vertical market offerings, and we plan to introduce our eMerge Supply Chain solution during the first half of the year 2000. Our objective is to aggressively pursue a diversified and extensive market by targeting companies that deal with complex supply chain issues. "
Doc2111,sapiens ,1999," The Euro Bandwagon Our winning EuroMigration?? solution positioned Sapiens as the undisputed leader in the euro transition market, and established our pan-European expertise, experience and presence. As we exploit this strength to implement euro migration projects for corporations such as 3M, Bosch and Air France, our European opportunities continue to expand. The euro has helped usher in the new era of e-business, and as the euro migration issue is resolved, the challenges of e-business will steadily increase. Sapiens?? eMerge offerings together with our lucrative EuroMigration installed base, secures our access to the emerging European e-business applications market. We will aggressively pursue this new market by capitalizing on our superior reputation and building on our established reference accounts. "
Doc2112,sapiens ,1999," Meeting Global Demand Sapiens arrived in the new millenium as a global corporation in every sense of the word. We established strategic alliances with industry leaders such as Cap Gemini, KPMG, IBM and CA to offer customers the most comprehensive solutions available in the global market. Sapiens is committed to finding new and innovative ways to leverage our resources in pursuit of value-focused global growth. Sapiens will maintain this strategy to continually strengthen our business presence and leadership position across the globe. "
Doc2113,sapiens ,1999," Sapiens was recently honored with a special award from the World Economic Forum. We were praised as being ??one of the 100 leading technology companies at the forefront of the knowledge economy,?? and recognized as ??a company that will continue to be a principal engine of growth well into the 21st century.?? This past January, in Davos, Switzerland, we were honored to stand among our colleagues to accept tribute and recognition for our contribution to the economic development and social progress of the world. "
Doc2114,sapiens ,1999," Expanding Our Competencies Leadership in the 21st century requires that we build greater competencies to meet the rapidly expanding demands for comprehensive and highly tailor-made e-business solution offerings. To meet this demand, we must align our resources in three fundamental domains: technology, business strategy, and marketing strategy. During the first quarter of the year 2000, we strengthened our competencies and aligned our resources by acquiring complementary businesses such as Internet Marketing Associates, an Internet design and consulting firm. By leveraging this confluence of skill sets, Sapiens will maintain its leadership position in delivering rapid, highly customized solutions. "
Doc2115,sapiens ,1999," eMerging Into the Future As we look ahead to the future, we see the exponential growth of business opportunities and possibilities. New business models are evolving as quickly as the technology that fuels them, accelerating the demand for pioneering technological solutions. Our development teams are dedicating significant resources to create new solutions and technologies in anticipation of these future trends. A perfect example is our recently announced initiative in the world of business-to-business (B2B) Internet marketplaces, which we will pursue through our newly formed subsidiary, eZoneXchange.com. The need to coordinate the IT systems of these marketplaces with those of their buyers and suppliers gives us an excellent opportunity to market our well-known strength in building business-driven solutions that integrate complex IT systems. Sapiens?? vision, creativity and pioneering innovations not only prepare us for the next wave of business reinvention, but also augment our reputation as a leading solution company. "
Doc2116,sapiens ,1999," New Appointments During the year, two senior executives were welcomed into our ranks. Mr. Dan Falk was appointed President and COO, and Mr. Yehuda Doron was appointed Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales and New Business Development. Both Messrs. Falk and Doron bring to Sapiens their vision, leadership and rich experiences. Their contribution will help propel our continued growth as we expand our global horizons and solidify our leadership position. "
Doc2117,sapiens ,1999," For our past successes and for the hard work and dedication that drive us into the future, we gratefully thank our employees. Our people represent Sapiens?? greatest competitive advantage and they are the catalysts for our ambitious plans in this rapidly changing world. On behalf of the entire Board of Directors, I would also like to thank our shareholders and partners for their continued support and confidence. "
Doc2118,sapiens ,2000,"In this first letter to you, the shareholders, as the head of the new management team at Sapiens, I would like to briefly review the problems encountered in 2000, but more importantly, I want to outline for you the recovery plan we are implementing for the Company and our business goals for the year ahead. "
Doc2119,sapiens ,2000," 2000 was a difficult year for Sapiens. Management had announced that 2000 would be a transition year for the Company as Sapiens sought to replace its Y2K line of business with new areas of growth in addition to its traditional solution offerings. This transition was harder than expected, compounded by both global and internal events. The Company suffered from external factors, such as the industry-wide slowdown in business volume and the sharp decline in the euro currency rate. Internally, much of management??s attention was focused on the failed merger with Ness Technologies rather than on confronting the acute market issues. To further complicate the problem, Sapiens?? cost base grew out of proportion relative to its current revenue generating capabilities, primarily due to heightened delivery requirements in some of our euro conversion projects and the Company??s B2B initiative through its eZoneX subsidiary. As a result, the Company recorded a net loss of $38.2 million for the year compared with net income of $13.1 million in 1999 on revenues of $72.7 million compared with $91.8 million in 1999. "
Doc2120,sapiens ,2000," Since assuming managerial responsibilities for Sapiens in December of last year, the new management team has initiated a focused and aggressive recovery program for the Company. We have set for ourselves an aggressive target of restoring Sapiens to profitability by Q4 of 2001. "
Doc2121,sapiens ,2000, The recovery plan aims to achieve this goal by leveraging four key assets of the Company: our core technologies; our key technical staff; our operational sales force; and our blue-chip customer base. 
Doc2122,sapiens ,2000," Our rules-based object technologies, continues to serve as the heart of vibrant software development and reengineering solutions that we uniquely provide to large-scale organizations worldwide. The key to maintaining our leading-edge in this highly competitive technology field remains our professional staff. I am pleased to report that despite our short-term problems, we have succeeded in retaining our highly skilled programmers and technical consultants. "
Doc2123,sapiens ,2000," We also have been able to strengthen and expand - not only maintain - our premier customer base and strategic partnerships. The successful launch of our Sapiens eMerge?? solution attracted a number of new customers. In the US, Media Services (a division of Time Warner), New Jersey Manufacturers, and Surplus Line Association of California. In France, we now include customers such as 3M, which is actually a pan-European customer, Groupe Andre, La SMABTP and Air France. In the UK we expanded our client list to include prestigious names such as Barclays, Bank of Ireland, Lloyds TSB, Prudential and Argos. "
Doc2124,sapiens ,2000," We also won significant new projects within our installed base of customers. These include projects with insurance companies such as Liverpool Victoria and AXA UK, and supply chain projects with companies such as Fun- Tees (US) and Media Services. Our strategic partnership with IBM, particulary in the U.S.A, expanded in the year 2000. Sapiens achieved the highest level of Certification on IBM's e-Business Application Framework and was also designated a Premier Partner in IBM's PartnerWorld for Developers. This strategic partnership allows Sapiens to broaden the market for its own solutions, gain access to specific types of domain expertise, and adapt our technologies and offerings more broadly. "
Doc2125,sapiens ,2000," Looking ahead into 2001, we believe that Sapiens is well-positioned to capitalize on corporate needs in the current business environment. The difficult market conditions facing the technology sector, in parallel to the overall economic slowdown, may create the need for the kinds of solutions that we provide for two important reasons. First, as large companies are forced to cut back on major capital investment, we anticipate a greater need to upgrade and/or migrate legacy systems. Second, as companies cut back on personnel, we expect a greater need to outsource maintenance and other IT functions to specialized external consultants. Sapiens?? software solutions and services, offered through four business lines (eMerge application development, Migrations, Outsourcing and IT Services), enable customers in all industries to capitalize on their existing IT assets and staff, while meeting new business demands. "
Doc2126,sapiens ,2000," eMerge Application Development is our primary business line. It includes rapid application development and reengineering, comprehensive application integrations, legacy renewal and creative front-end Web exposure. Our eMerge offering also features asset discovery - a global operational platform to assess, plan, carry out and manage all of the enterprise??s IT solutions and to assess inter-system and intra-system impacts. "
Doc2127,sapiens ,2000," Sapiens?? migration solutions assist customers in adapting their IT legacy systems to externally imposed changes, such as the advent of the Internet, or new regulatory or currency requirements (e.g. euro conversion), or internal upheavals such as mergers, acquisitions or new business models. Sapiens?? established migration methodologies are used in conjunction with the Company??s platform-independent technologies, while our project management experience and asset discovery solution play a major role in the migration of customers?? mission-critical systems. "
Doc2128,sapiens ,2000," In the role of providing outsourcing services, Sapiens can play the part of an internal IT team for ongoing IT functions such as application maintenance. Outsourcing projects can be performed either on or off the customers?? premises and, again, there is an important role here for Sapiens?? asset discovery solution, which contributes to the ongoing maintenance and management of an enterprise??s IT environment. "
Doc2129,sapiens ,2000," In performing specialized IT services, such as project management and technical assistance, Sapiens works together with the customer for the duration of the entire project, collectively undertaking design, development and deployment tasks, coupled with hands-on-training to achieve a rapid software solution to the customer??s business and IT goals. "
Doc2130,sapiens ,2000," I am pleased to report that we have successfully completed the initial phase of our recovery plan. More specifically, we are restructuring our organization to reduce costs, improve deliveries and streamline operations. During the last quarter of 2000 and first quarter of 2001, we reduced the number of total personnel by approximately 20% and lowered overhead costs in all areas, including office rental, travel, communications and car leasing expenses. We have closed offices in Brazil and Australia and re-aligned our offices in Germany and Spain, while cutting costs worldwide to significantly improve operational efficiencies. Of course, our existing customers in those territories, in which we closed or re-aligned our offices, will continue to get full support from our global operations. We have also closed the operations of eZoneX Inc. "
Doc2131,sapiens ,2000," In addition to the emphasis on cost reduction, we have also introduced tighter managerial controls. We have now successfully instituted monthly managerial reporting systems, as well as pricing and operating margin controls for long-term projects. "
Doc2132,sapiens ,2000," A key part of the initial phase of the recovery program was raising additional working capital in order to finance the recovery plan. As previously announced, an investor group, including Yarnfield International Ltd., an affiliate of the Magnum Technologies Fund, and The Formula Group, invested $15 million in exchange for convertible preferred stock. This capital raising transaction demonstrates a strategic as well as financial commitment by long-term investors who have a deep understanding of our industry. It acted as a strong vote of confidence in our future and a necessary part of our recovery plan. In addition to the funds from the private placement, the Company??s principal lenders, Bank Leumi and Bank Hapoalim have extended the Company??s credit lines by an additional $10 million - another vote of confidence, which gives us added financial resources to implement and execute our plan. "
Doc2133,sapiens ,2000," Having placed our short-term difficulties in a longer-term perspective, and described our progress in the recovery plan, I would like to introduce myself and our new management team. "
Doc2134,sapiens ,2000," I joined Sapiens in November 2000 with experience in leading companies to profitability and growth. I led the growth of Nilit Industries from 1994 through 2000, during which time the company achieved worldwide market recognition and annual revenues grew steadily to reach approximately $160 million. Prior to joining Nilit, I led a comprehensive turnaround of Orlite Industries from 1990 through 1994. I come from an engineering background where my experience includes managing engineering teams at Israel Aircraft Industries and Israel??s Nuclear Research Center. "
Doc2135,sapiens ,2000," Joining me as our new CFO is Yuval Hadari, who comes to us with broad experience in the area of finance and administration. Yuval??s experience includes positions as VP Finance and CFO of Nilit Ltd. from 1996 to the present and CFO of Scitex Europe S.A. from 1991 through 1995. "
Doc2136,sapiens ,2000," Amos Shattner, who has joined us as our EVP Technologies and Operations, has wide-ranging experience in management of information systems, marketing and sales and finance. Amos most recently served as CEO of Varicom Communications, an Israeli start-up in the telecom industry. "
Doc2137,sapiens ,2000," Yuval and Amos join Jacob Sivan in his new global role as EVP Marketing and Sales, Haim Zysberg as Chief Technology Officer, and Steve Kronengold, our General Counsel, to form Sapiens?? new executive management team. Together with our regional heads -- Gil Arbel, VP for the Americas, Yair Spitzer, VP UK, Saadia Essoudry, VP France, Yechiel Gepner, VP Israel, and Ruvik Barkan, VP Sales and ROW -- the global management team is initiating not only tighter cost controls, but also aggressive sales initiatives as a core element of the recovery program. "
Doc2138,sapiens ,2000," In summary, having successfully completed the first phase of our recovery plan and with significant business opportunities on the horizon, the new management team looks forward with confidence and optimism. Sapiens remains a fundamentally sound company that is experiencing short-term difficulties, but has very attractive upside opportunity. Our accumulated assets form a solid foundation for recovery and future growth. "
Doc2139,sapiens ,2000," On behalf of the entire management team I want to thank you for your continued commitment and confidence in our ability to restore Sapiens back to growth and profitability. At this time next year, I hope to present a report of a different nature. "
Doc2140,sapiens ,2001,"A little less than one year ago, I shared my concerns with you about the challenges that faced the Company and outlined a comprehensive recovery effort that our management team put in place. Today, I am happy to report that we have met or exceeded almost all of the goals of our recovery plan and are now able to tackle new challenges and opportunities as a healthy, viable company with a positive, upbeat vision and long-term strategic focus. "
Doc2141,sapiens ,2001," Before I continue with a review of the highlights of 2001 and our work plan for 2002, I would like to thank you, on behalf of the management and employees of Sapiens, for your vote of confidence during the past year which enabled us to implement an aggressive recovery plan and lay the groundwork to become the business solution provider of choice to the Insurance industry. "
Doc2142,sapiens ,2001," While we are proud of the turnaround effort in 2001, we are mindful of the prevailing global recession and difficult conditions in the software industry in particular. We look forward to the future with confidence, and have targeted the year 2002 as the year in which we make long transitional strides towards our vision. We are prepared to invest in that promising vision even at the cost of short-term profits because of the relevance of our technology to the emerging needs of insurance and other financial sector industries. Our approach is to maintain a careful watch on our cost structure as we gradually grow our operations and build a lasting legacy that we can all be proud of for many years to come. "
Doc2143,sapiens ,2001, 2001: A Year of Recovery The following highlights of 2001 are representative of the re-vamping of our operations and business approach: 
Doc2144,sapiens ,2001, We implemented a strong adjustment of the Company??s cost structure based primarily on reducing headcount and associated costs and streamlining our operations to achieve maximum efficiencies. The net result: Operating costs were reduced by almost 50%. 
Doc2145,sapiens ,2001," We restored our customers?? confidence and, as a result, gradually increased order entry and revenues. The net result: Our revenue backlog entering 2002 increased by more than 20% over the backlog entering 2001. "
Doc2146,sapiens ,2001," We achieved a steady increase in our gross profit margin, reflecting improved revenue mix, project delivery and resource utilization. The net result: Our gross profit margin rose to 40% at the end of 2001 from negative 27% at the end of the year 2000. "
Doc2147,sapiens ,2001," We closely managed our cash resources and significantly outperformed our cash management projections. The net result: We achieved positive cash flow from our operations in the second half of 2001 and ??burned?? $5.5 million over the course of the year, 70% less than budgeted for the year. "
Doc2148,sapiens ,2001," We kept our commitment to focus on shareholder value. The net result: We achieved profitability in the fourth quarter of 2001, as targeted at the start of the year. "
Doc2149,sapiens ,2001," We dedicated management attention and key resources to the formulation of a solid, long-term growth plan for the Company. The net result: We have a focused business vision of our future. "
Doc2150,sapiens ,2001," Throughout 2001, we conducted an in-depth study of capabilities and strengths as well as industry needs with the help of independent consultants and identified the Insurance Industry as a strategic vertical focus that is uniquely suited to our core competencies and intellectual, brand and technology capital. With more than 50 clients in the insurance industry, we have a unique understanding of the business processes and IT needs of that industry. "
Doc2151,sapiens ,2001, One of the primary challenges within the insurance industry is the need to adapt core business processes to evolving business and regulatory requirements. Transforming and modernizing the business requires both enhanced and flexible Insurance Solutions coupled with effective Legacy Lifecycle Management. Our strategy is clear: 
Doc2152,sapiens ,2001," Develop flexible component-based solutions for insurance claims processing, policy management, multi-channel connectivity and closed books administration. These frameworks combine the benefits of component-based architecture with the flexibility of highly customized development. "
Doc2153,sapiens ,2001, Leverage our solid technology heritage in transforming legacy systems to become a leading global provider of cost-effective business solutions to the insurance industry. 
Doc2154,sapiens ,2001," In terms of target markets, we have identified the United States and the United Kingdom as the primary focal points of our insurance initiative, with Israel as a strategic and R&D base. Our plan further calls for leveraging our success in these territories to help us strengthen our market presence in France, Germany, Switzerland and Japan. "
Doc2155,sapiens ,2001," We realize that our pursuit of global leadership in the insurance industry will require us to allocate resources, in the areas of marketing and Research and Development. We are prepared to make that investment, which will compromise short-term profitability to some extent, in order to establish global leadership and brand awareness which we believe will translate into sales to pay back our investment. "
Doc2156,sapiens ,2001," The year 2001 saw the continued strength of our UK operation, both in revenues and order entry, and the emergence of our U.S. operation to a rightful leadership position. These key operations continue to service and gain the confidence of a blue-chip customer base that we believe gives us a solid foundation for future growth. In UK alone, we signed large orders with leading organizations such as National Australia Group, Liverpool Victoria Friendly Society, Panasonic UK, AXA UK, Prudential UK, Aegon and EDS Credit Services- a joint venture between Abbey National and EDS. Our deepening relationship with EDS is particularly important for our long-term growth plan. "
Doc2157,sapiens ,2001," In the U.S., we recently signed a large-scale project with a leading insurer that immediately adds a marketable, component-based solution to our insurance offerings. We also signed orders with leading organizations such as Surplus Line Association of California, International Paper, New Jersey Manufacturers and IBM Mechanicsburg. We recognize the critical importance of the U.S. market to our long-term plans and are particularly pleased with the strengthening of our U.S. operation. "
Doc2158,sapiens ,2001," Our long-term alliance with IBM is a key relationship for us primarily in the U.S. and the UK, if not worldwide, and we are in the process of expanding its scope. "
Doc2159,sapiens ,2001," Our other operations, including our oncedominant activity in France, did not have similar success in 2001. This operation is in a rebuilding stage primarily as a result of not being able to leverage our Y2K and euro market positions. The results of our operations in Germany and Japan are stagnant and our operation in Israel is under competitive pressure. The challenge going forward is to translate the success of our U.S. and UK operations to these other territories, which we have identified as strategic markets for our long-term growth plan. "
Doc2160,sapiens ,2001," As 2001 was the ??Year of Recovery??, 2002 is the ??Year of Transition??. This is not merely a slogan, but a significant migration of our entire organization to the business of developing and providing flexible solution frameworks to the Insurance industry. Here are some of the ??must?? elements that need to be developed in our transition to Insurance: "
Doc2161,sapiens ,2001," Develop a comprehensive R&D, Marketing and Sales program for the insurance solution offerings. "
Doc2162,sapiens ,2001, Reposition and create market awareness of our capabilities and offerings. 
Doc2163,sapiens ,2001, Strengthen and re-align our core eMerge technologies to the generic needs of the Insurance market. 
Doc2164,sapiens ,2001, Develop in-house insurance domain expertise within out targeted offerings. 
Doc2165,sapiens ,2001," Deepen marketing alliances with key industry players, such as IBM and EDS on the global level, and with local players in each strategic territory. "
Doc2166,sapiens ,2001, Grow order entry and revenue backlog with an emphasis on the insurance and financial services industries. 
Doc2167,sapiens ,2001, Maintain a close watch on our cost infrastructure during the entire transitional phase. 
Doc2168,sapiens ,2001," As will be our practice for years to come, we have identified qualitative goals for the year 2002 that we consider of critical importance to achievement of our long-term plans. "
Doc2169,sapiens ,2001," The first is Customer Care. Service excellence to our trusted customers is a constant priority of the Sapiens culture for long-term success. Just as our customers have showed confidence in us, we are continually dedicated to finding new ways to provide the highest standards of service to our customers. Their satisfaction with our role as business par tner and achievement of competitive advantage through our solutions are our guiding principles. "
Doc2170,sapiens ,2001," The second is Quality. Our ability to compete with industry giants is a testament to the quality, agility and innovativeness of our people and technology solutions. We are determined to improve on that qualitative advantage throughout every facet of our development process and consulting. Nearly ever y organization talks about the value of its people, but we have objective evidence: We have succeeded in winning competition for largescale projects against some of the ??forces?? in the industry on the basis of talent and agility of our people and technology. "
Doc2171,sapiens ,2001," On a more personal note, I would like to express my appreciation to: "
Doc2172,sapiens ,2001," Our customers, who stood with us through difficult times. We will, more than ever before, do our absolute utmost to strengthen your confidence and trust and make this a cornerstone of our New Sapiens. "
Doc2173,sapiens ,2001," Our employees, for their endless devotion and talent. Our 600 colleagues around the world are dedicated as one to give valueadded solutions and services to their businesses. "
Doc2174,sapiens ,2001," Our management team, which worked tirelessly to achieve our goals in 2001. The strength and commitment of this team inspires confidence in our ability to meet the challenges going forward. "
Doc2175,sapiens ,2001," While we are fortunate to have met expectations and accomplished our mission for 2001, we should not forget that we reported significant annual losses and we are not about to declare victory. The challenges ahead of us are formidable and the global economic crisis continues to affect everyone. The confidence that we have in our long-term plan will enable us to overcome the hurdles ahead. I am personally committed to the success of our company and to continue to deliver on our commitments to you, our shareholders. "
Doc2176,sapiens ,2002,"The year 2002 marked the beginning of a new chapter in the history of Sapiens. Sapiens delivered on its promise to establish a strong foothold in the global insurance industry, while improving the Company??s financial performance. Our efforts to enable insurance enterprises to consolidate and enhance their processes and legacy IT systems have begun to gain momentum. During the past twelve months, our management team has built and marketed a focused vision, creating a visible resource for the insurance industry??s value chain. "
Doc2177,sapiens ,2002," The insurance industry is recovering in certain segments and I expect that it will need to upgrade its IT systems in order to adapt to changes in the market. I remain both confident and optimistic in our continued efforts to become a leading supplier to the insurance world. Following the launch of the Sapiens INSIGHT?? solution suite, early adopters who have put their new systems in production, report significant return on their investments. At the same time, we are gaining increased recognition for our solutions within the insurance marketplace and expect new insurance companies to join our customer base. "
Doc2178,sapiens ,2002," Our move into insurance necessitates a serious internal strategic realignment in terms of how we best use our personnel resources, research and development capabilities and other assets. "
Doc2179,sapiens ,2002," During 2002, we made significant progress in becoming a leader in fulfilling the needs of the insurance sector. "
Doc2180,sapiens ,2002," We launched our Insurance Solutions Practice (ISP) in North America, the United Kingdom and EMEA to better service the increasing business and technology needs of the insurance sector. The practice focuses on fulfilling the business process demands of the property and casualty (P&C) and life and pension (L&P) insurance markets by providing modular, webenabled business solutions that help align IT systems to improve operational performance and effectiveness. The practice includes a group of insurance domain specialists who not only lead our efforts but provide thoughtleadership to the industry. In the last twelve months, we have welcomed to our ranks Judy Johnson, Debby Lerman, Brian Meigh and Mely Lerman, each one a recognized insurance expert bringing decades of experience to the Company. Their creativity is already helping our customers in addressing their business needs. "
Doc2181,sapiens ,2002," We strengthened senior management with the recruitment of David Ofek as corporate EVP for Business Development & Marketing, and Dan Trajman as the President of Sapiens Americas. David brings with him years of experience as a senior executive in the Scitex Corporation group, including CEO of Objet-Geometries and President & CEO of Scitex Europe. Dan comes to Sapiens after serving as CEO in iKnowledge Inc. and CTI Squared Inc., a co-founder and managing director in LTMI and Executive Vice President of marketing and business development with L&H N.V. "
Doc2182,sapiens ,2002," We introduced and deployed Sapiens INSIGHT??, a suite of modular business solutions that make use of existing assets to quickly and cost-effectively modernize insurance business processes. "
Doc2183,sapiens ,2002," In the US this year, the Company helped insurance provider OneBeacon become an industry leader. Utilizing innovative technology and a team of industry experts, the Company helped to consolidate OneBeacon??s seven systems, yielding a common platform and operational cost reductions of more than 60%. The significant streamlining has led to a more satisfied agent community and better service to the consumer. Agents can now dynamically set choices and change parameters to modify a product for increased personalization in drastically shorter time frames. Our Policy INSIGHT solution for the P&C insurance sector is now a marketable business model for Sapiens, which can be used by insurance organizations to bridge the technology gap, improve customer service and reduce administration costs significantly. "
Doc2184,sapiens ,2002," In the UK, Sapiens generated significant cost savings for Liverpool Victoria, the UK??s largest Friendly Society that provides a wide range of products and services in Life Assurance, Pensions, General Insurance and Banking. The implementation of our Closed Books INSIGHT solution has reduced the cost of administration of its 3.5 million policies by about 50%, to make Liverpool Victoria the leader in policy administration efficiencies and a market benchmark. The new solution offers one-stop process execution, reduced training needs and costs, greater transactional throughput, better management information, improved reliability and improved financial control. "
Doc2185,sapiens ,2002, The 2002 financial results reflect overall improvement when compared to those of 2001: 
Doc2186,sapiens ,2002," Revenues remained virtually unchanged (a slight increase of 2%). However, within the total revenues, there was 24% growth in product revenues resulting from our focused efforts on sales of licenses and license upgrades. "
Doc2187,sapiens ,2002," Gross profit increased 38%, fueled by the improved ratio of product revenues within the revenues mix, together with the continued realignment of costs and improved utilization of resources. The reduced dollar value of gross profit from consulting and other services was largely offset by the high increase of gross profit from products. "
Doc2188,sapiens ,2002," Gross margin from product revenues was up 46%, and from services, up 13%. The positive shift toward sales of software solutions, with improved pricing and efficient deliveries to customers, was the major contributor to the improvement. In addition, we were able to improve the gross margin from services by concentrating on those services which provided higher profit margins. "
Doc2189,sapiens ,2002," We reduced selling, general and administrative expenses by 17%. Continuing the processes and efforts instituted in 2001, we reduced costs in almost every area of the Company??s activities by reducing headcount and streamlining our operations. "
Doc2190,sapiens ,2002," For the first time in four years, our operations generated positive cash flow of about $1 million. Cost reductions, increased efficiency and improved collections all made their mark. Setting aside certain non-recurring accruals, 2002 would have been operationally profitable. "
Doc2191,sapiens ,2002, We still had a net loss of $5.2 million for the year but that was an improvement of over 71% from the previous year??s loss of $18 million. 
Doc2192,sapiens ,2002," It should be noted that in spite of the year over year improvement, we experienced a slowdown in revenues toward the end of the year that impacted the results of the fourth quarter. This trend continued into the early part of 2003 as well. "
Doc2193,sapiens ,2002," The year 2002 saw continued strengthening in various aspects of our operations. Sapiens UK continued its strong performance. Sapiens Americas grew significantly to catch up to the UK, while our French and German subsidiaries underperformed as they shed older, non-profitable and non-strategic elements of the business. "
Doc2194,sapiens ,2002, I would like to expand on some of the areas in which a solid infrastructure is being constructed up going forward: 
Doc2195,sapiens ,2002," In both the UK and the Americas we increased our application development business related to Sapiens eMerge??, our rules-based rapid application development (RAD) suite. "
Doc2196,sapiens ,2002, Sapiens is the major supplier for the joint venture between EDS and Abbey National (the second largest provider of mortgages and savings in the UK) in the development and enhancement of their platform for loans and mortgages. 
Doc2197,sapiens ,2002, Sapiens eMerge was selected as the core rules-based engine for the Internal Revenue Service??s modernization program led by CSC as the prime contractor. 
Doc2198,sapiens ,2002," We expanded considerably our Service Maintenance Practice (SMP), offering our customers improved efficiencies and reduced costs for maintaining and enhancing their applications. "
Doc2199,sapiens ,2002," In order to accelerate our market positioning, we have successfully entered into relationships with leading insurance consulting and management firms such as Impact Plus and Rowlings in the UK and CastleBay and Blue Cod in North America. In France, Germany and Israel, we have engaged insurance industry experts and created advisory boards. "
Doc2200,sapiens ,2002," The quality of our products and deliveries, based on our eMerge technology and RAD methodology, proved Sapiens unique delivery capabilities throughout the year, demonstrated by a marked improvement in customer satisfaction. "
Doc2201,sapiens ,2002," We implemented an integrated ERP information system that fully supports all financial, project management and customer relations needs. "
Doc2202,sapiens ,2002," We were greatly aided in all our activities by the additional investment of $10 million by the Formula Group late in the year. As a result of Formula??s conversion of its previous holdings of preferred shares to common stock, the 2002 investment and additional open-market purchases in 2003, Formula now holds a little more than 50% of our outstanding common shares. The support of the Formula Group, an international, publicly held software group, will enhance Sapiens?? efforts to become a leading provider of technology solutions for the global insurance industry. "
Doc2203,sapiens ,2002, The progress we made in 2002 does not completely dispel our concerns for the future. The year 2002 began strong but the continuing slowdown in the global economy contributed to a decrease of revenues and an operational loss for the fourth quarter of 2002 and the early part of 2003. 
Doc2204,sapiens ,2002," It is no secret that economic conditions across all markets continue to be difficult and the signs of recovery that have emerged are still far from the imminent realization we all hope for. The IT market, which has been our traditional bread and butter, remains sluggish. The insurance sector, Sapiens?? long-term strategic market, is experiencing its most challenging period in recent history. Increased liabilities, failed investments in capital markets, escalating operational costs and new legislative and regulatory requirements all point to a need for a revised insurance business model, driven by significant cost cutting. "
Doc2205,sapiens ,2002," Building on successes during 2002 and the positive indications of recovery that we are seeing in the insurance market, the Company moves forward with a single, clear focus on the global insurance industry. We will continue to streamline our business objectives and make the maximum use of our multidisciplinary teams to build and support superior insurance solutions so that our clients can create competitive advantage. "
Doc2206,sapiens ,2002," In closing, I want to express my highest regard to our customers for the confidence they place in Sapiens. It is our privilege and honor to serve them in the best way possible. I also want to thank my colleagues   employees and management   for devoting their outstanding talents and neverending efforts to achieving Sapiens?? goals. The road ahead remains ??bumpy,?? but we are dedicated to achieving consistent profitability for the Company. I fully believe, as I have since I joined Sapiens in late 2000, that the Company will be able to justify the commitment that you, our shareholders, have demonstrated in these demanding times. "
Doc2207,sapiens ,2003,"The year 2003 was one of mixed results for Sapiens. We did not achieve our targets, either in new orders or in revenues. Our market penetration to new insurance customers was slower than expected, while at the same time the income from our traditional installed customer base decreased somewhat. However, through tight control on expenses we were able to improve our net results, reducing losses significantly in spite of a decline in revenues. "
Doc2208,sapiens ,2003," We saw the signs of slowdown early in the year, as indicated in my last year letter to you, and thus we were cautious in our forecasts, describing the road ahead as ??bumpy.?? Toward the end of 2003, we seemed to be on the right track, both returning to profitability and building a stronger pipeline. We were all disappointed to learn during the early part of 2004 that the transition would require more time. We are therefore taking the measures believed to lead to profitability before the end of 2004 and see 2005 as a more realistic target for our success in transitioning to the insurance industry while returning to growth. "
Doc2209,sapiens ,2003," Building on our early achievements, we made significant additional progress during 2003 by increasing our assets and capabilities in addressing the needs of the insurance industry. "
Doc2210,sapiens ,2003, We improved and expanded on the functionality of our existing INSIGHT solutions   Policy and Closed Books. 
Doc2211,sapiens ,2003," We added new products to our INSIGHT suite of solutions: o Life&Pensions, a comprehensive system in the Life Insurance field o Medirisk, an automated medical underwriting system o ReInsurance, addressing treaties and regulatory requirements. "
Doc2212,sapiens ,2003," We strengthened our insurance domain expertise, both internally, through hiring experienced business analysts, actuaries and underwriters as well as externally, through associates and by adding experienced industry veterans to our Board of Directors. "
Doc2213,sapiens ,2003," We made significant progress on the roadmap of our underlying eMerge technology, enabling open architecture and modern protocols such as XML, Business-Component and Web services. At the same time, we have empowered our insurance solutions with modularity and flexibility in the architecture of our INSIGHT suite of solutions. "
Doc2214,sapiens ,2003," Total revenues for 2003 decreased by almost 20%. However, we improved our gross profit margin somewhat due to marginal but continued overall improvement in revenue mix, project delivery and utilization of resources. "
Doc2215,sapiens ,2003," We reduced selling, general and administrative expenses by about 10% as a result of planned and consistent efficiency measures we implemented. These measures included, among other things, a decrease in the work force and office areas, and improvements in procurement terms in all areas. "
Doc2216,sapiens ,2003," Continuing the trend of the last two years, as compared with 2002 we reduced our net loss by almost 60%, primarily due to improved gross profit margins and lower operating expenses. "
Doc2217,sapiens ,2003," In March 2003, we listed our common shares on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) in parallel with Nasdaq. The dual-listing effectively reduces the Israeli capital gains tax from the sale of the Company??s shares by Israeli shareholders to 15% compared with the previous 35% rate. We hope that in the long run, the listing on TASE will broaden the pool of investors who actively trade in our shares. "
Doc2218,sapiens ,2003, An immediate advantage of the dual listing was that it allowed us to make an offering of convertible debentures in the Israeli market in December 2003. Our cash position and liquidity were greatly improved by the successful offering of about 18.5 million dollars. We are grateful for the confidence in Sapiens demonstrated by the financial community and the Israeli public. 
Doc2219,sapiens ,2003," In June 2003, with the approval of the shareholders, we implemented a 1-for-5 reverse stock split of our common shares to meet the listing requirements of Nasdaq. We took this step because in January 2003, Nasdaq informed us that our common shares would be delisted from Nasdaq as a result of not maintaining compliance with Nasdaq??s $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing. In order to avoid delisting, we requested and received Nasdaq??s approval to carry out the reverse split. Since that time, we have maintained compliance with the minimum bid requirement. "
Doc2220,sapiens ,2003," With the Formula Group now being in control, the composition of our Board of Directors changed as well. We welcome to the Board Naamit Salomon of the Formula Group and independent directors Yeoshua Agassi, Yocheved Dvir and Rammy Ringel. To the veteran directors who left the Board   Michel Berty, Kenneth Bialkin, Robert Libutti, Tsvi Misinai and Shai Sole   we give our thanks for their years of service and our best wishes for success in their other activities. "
Doc2221,sapiens ,2003, All efforts are being geared to creating value for our shareholders by achieving profitability and building on our values and assets. 
Doc2222,sapiens ,2003," I am happy to report that in the early part of 2004 we created an International Advisory Board composed of highly-regarded members of the insurance industry: Rob White-Cooper (formerly Chairman of Marsh & McLennan International); Bob Scott (formerly CEO of CGNU, now AVIVA); Bob Mendelsohn (formerly CEO of Royal & Sun Alliance), Kaj Ahlmann (formerly CEO of GE Frankona) and Rudolf Kellenberger (Deputy CEO of Swiss Re). The Advisory Board??s mission is to support Sapiens in its market penetration to the insurance industry. "
Doc2223,sapiens ,2003," In order to strengthen our presence in the US, we recruited Steven Bessellieu as the new President of Sapiens Americas and Richard Wiedenbeck as VP Insurance Solutions. Steven has been a consultant and senior executive in the insurance industry for 25 years, serving most recently as president of Sherwood International. Richard comes to Sapiens with more than 15 years?? experience in senior management and consulting roles in the insurance industry. "
Doc2224,sapiens ,2003," During 2004, we will be focusing on the following areas: "
Doc2225,sapiens ,2003, Continuing and improving our level of services with our existing customer base. We are proud to have them as our customers and we will do everything in our power to keep them satisfied. 
Doc2226,sapiens ,2003," Continuing with our strategic plan of becoming a leading supplier of software Solutions to the insurance industry, while focusing on those solutions which promise to accelerate our transition. "
Doc2227,sapiens ,2003," Weighing the possibility of an acquisition, probably in the United States, in order to add strategic technology and expand our insurance customer base. We strongly believe that such a move would be an excellent use of the proceeds from the debenture offering in creating shareholder value. "
Doc2228,sapiens ,2003, Maintaining a trim organization and tight control on expenses with the emphasis on sales and marketing. 
Doc2229,sapiens ,2003," Adopting a realistic approach, we hope to see the year 2005 as the year in which we will return to growth, while 2004 will be predominantly used for building the needed elements for a successful transition to the insurance industry. "
Doc2230,sapiens ,2003," In closing, we continue to have every confidence in our long-term plan to achieve growth and profitability. Our shareholders, customers and employees are the sources of our strength. I thank you all personally and I remain committed to turning the ship around in spite of troubled waters and low visibility. "
Doc2231,sybase ,1995,"Sybase has just concluded one of our most challenging years since we started business in 1984. After leading the enterprise client/server relational database software and services industry in revenue growth and achieving record-breaking annual revenues and earnings yearly since becoming a public company in 1991, we reported slower revenue growth in 1995 and operating earnings below those achieved in 1994. However, we also accomplished a great deal of positive change during this past year, and I believe we begin 1996 a much stronger company in all major operational areas. "
Doc2232,sybase ,1995," Here are our financial results as they stood at year end. Revenues in 1995 grew 16 percent from 1994, reaching a record $957 million. International revenues increased 41 percent to $368 million, expanding as a percentage of total revenues to 38 percent, up from 32 percent in 1994. Income for 1995, before taxes and one-time charges, was $29 million. Including the one-time charges of approximately $44 million related to our merger with Powersoft Corporation and our acquisition of SDP, S.A., the net loss for 1995 was $2 0 million, or $0.27 per share. "
Doc2233,sybase ,1995, Our year-end balance sheet was strong: cash and short-term investments equaled $224 million; days sales outstanding in accounts receivables equaled 65 days; and stockholders?? equity reached $440 million with virtually no debt. 
Doc2234,sybase ,1995," Sybase??s below-plan performance for 1995 was principally the result of a decline in database license revenue growth caused by a confluence of issues. To address these issues, we devised and implemented programs for improving the company??s performance. The initiatives Sybase instituted concentrated on four goals: launching a new generation of Sybase??s highly scalable and feature-rich relational database products, clarifying our central marketing message, making our application partners more successful, and increasing the productivity of our sales organization. "
Doc2235,sybase ,1995," By October, we accomplished the first, and most essential, of these goals when we announced globally, via satellite and the Internet, Sybase System 11??, a family of relational database management system (RDBMS) products united by a single architecture, yet performance optimized for specific applications. Eagerly awaited, our flagship database product, SQL Server?? 11, achieved record-breaking results soon after its launch for performance, scalability, and quality on Digital Equipment Corporation, Hewlett-Packard, and Sun Microsystems platforms. Response to System 11 from customers, industry analysts, and software application vendors has been spectacular. "
Doc2236,sybase ,1995," Revitalized marketing programs now effectively communicate the Sybase integrated product strategy: Sybase provides a complete offering of modular and adaptive products that work together through a single, highly flexible client/server architecture. We show customers how Sybase solutions uniquely meet the needs of existing and emerging markets for database software: on-line transaction processing (OLTP), data warehouse, mass deployment, and the electronic marketplace. "
Doc2237,sybase ,1995," The company activated programs to assist and motivate software application vendors and hardware manufacturers to bring to market products that work well with Sybase products. As a result, we increased the number of worldwide Open Solutions?? partners in 1995 to more than 2,600, an increase of 45 percent from 1994. "
Doc2238,sybase ,1995," We continued to increase our sales productivity. The Sybase direct field sales force and telesales organizations are focused on serving the expanding, diverse requirements of our global, strategic, and major accounts. We added significant expertise to address the unique requirements of vertical application markets. Sales training is at its highest level ever. And to sell a broader range of products, we are now using Powersoft??s successful organizational model for supporting sales through indirect and alternative channels. "
Doc2239,sybase ,1995," Despite the challenges we faced in 1995, Sybase scored many important multimillion-dollar customer wins, including Bell South, Teleport Communications Group (TCG), 3M, Time Warner, and True North Communications, Inc. During the year, we added 7,200 directly supported new customer sites for a total of 27,300 sites, an increase of 36 percent from 1994. "
Doc2240,sybase ,1995," By year end, we made significant progress on our four major 1995 initiatives, which is reflected in our fourth quarter financial results. Revenues in the fourth quarter were a record-high $ 267 million, up 15 percent sequentially from the preceding third quarter. License revenues in the fourth quarter increased 23 percent sequentially, or $33 million, over the preceding third quarter, the best sequential improvement we have generated in eight quarters. These results are encouraging as Sybase enters 1996. "
Doc2241,sybase ,1995," Sybase also accomplished many things that we believe position us strongly for the year ahead. Most notably, we completed our merger with Powersoft Corporation, adding distribution channel expertise, industry-leading application development tools, and workplace products to our product line. "
Doc2242,sybase ,1995," Product development proceeded briskly throughout the year as Sybase invested a substantial percentage of revenue, 16 percent, in research and development. As a result, Sybase is now releasing the richest flow of new products in its history. Additionally, Sybase invested more than $12 million in programs that increase the quality of our products and services. Sybase is North America??s first independent software developer to have nearly all of its operating divisions fully compliant with the International Standards Organization??s ISO 9000 standards for quality assurance. The industry continues to recognize Sybase products for their high quality and technical excellence. "
Doc2243,sybase ,1995," Another major accomplishment in 1995 was that revenue from Sybase Consulting Services increased $70 million to 19 percent of 1995??s total revenue, up from 13 percent in 1994. "
Doc2244,sybase ,1995," In 1995, Sybase reorganized its management team. All product groups and Worldwide Services, Marketing, and Sales were consolidated under Chief Operating Officer David Peterschmidt. This improves our customer focus and increases direct accountability for the success of each product and each operational area. With this change, I have great confidence in our management team??s ability to lead Sybase to renewed profitability. "
Doc2245,sybase ,1995," We also increased the strength, expertise, and vision of the Sybase board of directors by adding Mitchell Kertzman, Sybase executive vice president and Powersoft CEO; Frank Ingari, chairman and CEO of Shiva Corporation; Bill Krause, president and CEO of Storm Software and one of the founders of 3Com Corporation; and Bob Wayman, executive vice president and CFO of Hewlett-Packard Company. "
Doc2246,sybase ,1995," In conclusion, I firmly believe that Sybase is a significantly stronger company today than it was just a year ago. We begin 1996 with all the necessary ingredients to move Sybase forward in the year ahead: a clear market strategy, the richest and most diversified product line in our history, a multi-tiered distribution channel, and a highly focused management organization. Perhaps most importantly, all Sybase employees remain dedicated to what we call ??Customer Integrity,?? ensuring that everything we do contributes to the long-term interests of our customers. I look forward to an exciting 1996. "
Doc2247,sybase ,1996,"As we begin 1997, I feel very positive about Sybase. Since I was appointed president and CEO in July of 1996, we have spent considerable time looking back at our difficulties. This year we set and accomplished the immediate goals of reducing expenses and returning to operating profitability in the second half of 1996. We have critically reassessed our strengths. And we have carefully targeted those areas where we need to improve to gain both market and technological leadership. "
Doc2248,sybase ,1996," Here are our financial results as they stood at year-end. Revenues in 1996 expanded 6 percent from 1995, reaching a record $1.0 billion. International revenues increased 8 percent to $395.8 million, expanding as a percentage of total revenues to 39 percent, up from 38 percent in 1995. "
Doc2249,sybase ,1996," Pretax loss, before a restructuring charge, totaled $17.5 million. After the charge and taxes, the company had a net loss for 1996 of $79.0 million or $1.05 per share. The Company had a sound financial base at year-end. Cash and short-term investments were $174.5 million, days sales outstanding in accounts receivables at year-end 1996 equaled 80 days, and stockholders?? equity reached $396.8 million with essentially no debt. "
Doc2250,sybase ,1996," It is important to review our third and fourth quarter results separately from the first half of last year. We began our return to profitability in the third quarter of 1996 with a modest operating income of $0.6 million before a $49.2 million charge to cover a restructuring of the company??s operations. In the fourth quarter, we posted an operating income of $9.7 million and demonstrated incremental improvement from the profitable base we established in the third quarter. "
Doc2251,sybase ,1996," We believe that we have business and operational models in place to increase profitability going forward. In the year ahead, we are looking for new areas of growth and profitability. "
Doc2252,sybase ,1996," Now, it is time to look forward and redefine Sybase. The company is setting its own agenda for leadership and will not take a ??me too?? position in the marketplace. We have assessed who we are, what we believe in, and which customers we can serve best. I am confident that today Sybase clearly stands out from its competitors through an absolute commitment to protecting customers?? freedom of choice. "
Doc2253,sybase ,1996," At Sybase, we believe that our customers should be in complete control of their own destinies. Although our competitors speak of openness, when you peel back the top levels of their strategies, you find that their solutions are actually becoming more proprietary and moving customers back toward the recentralization of enterprise data and application architectures. These proprietary strategies fundamentally limit customers?? options. "
Doc2254,sybase ,1996," In contrast, Sybase is firmly committed to open solutions that empower customers to choose the architecture and products that best serve their needs. We help customers decide whether or not to distribute or centralize data and application logic and architectures. We let customers choose whether to integrate or replace legacy systems. We enable customers to select the platform they wish to use. And we leave it to customers to choose one information standard over another, such as ActiveX versus Java or CORBA versus DCOM. At Sybase, we are committed to flexibility and customer empowerment, not controlling customers?? options. "
Doc2255,sybase ,1996," With this commitment to customer choice in mind, we are implementing product, marketing, and organizational strategies that carry forward this new definition into the marketplace. In particular, there are four key points where Sybase clearly differentiates itself: "
Doc2256,sybase ,1996," Distributed Computing: Our products allow customers to create computing infrastructures that put information exactly where it is needed and where it can be most effective. We believe that recentralizing enterprise data and application architectures is a step backward for most strategic applications; it does not fit the way businesses are organized. Rather than movement of data out of business units and into a central corporate repository, our goal is to help customers manage distributed information more effectively. "
Doc2257,sybase ,1996," Openness: Unlike other database vendors, Sybase is committed to an open architecture. This means that customers maintain the flexibility to use information from many different sources, no matter where the data are located or the platform on which they reside. We would love for customers to buy all their products from Sybase, but if another technology works better for them, we want them to use it. Sybase products interoperate successfully with a customer??s existing systems and with technologies from other vendors, which saves our customers money. "
Doc2258,sybase ,1996," High Performance: Performance has always been a hallmark of our products and a key reason customers choose Sybase. Today, many Sybase products outperform their competition. In the year ahead, we fully intend to be the performance leader for the entire product line. "
Doc2259,sybase ,1996," End-to-End Solutions: Customers should have the right to have all the elements of their information systems work together. At Sybase, we provide complete technology solutions, composed of design and development tools, middleware, and distributed databases. This allows us to integrate object-oriented technologies throughout our products. "
Doc2260,sybase ,1996," With these messages in hand, we can clearly differentiate Sybase in the marketplace and show what distinguishes Sybase from its competitors. We can also more readily identify customers who can benefit most from a Sybase solution. "
Doc2261,sybase ,1996," The prototypical Sybase customer looks to information technology to supply a strategic, competitive advantage not just to perform back office operations. For example, Federal Express, an important customer we have featured in our advertisements, views technology as central to its business. When a company such as Federal Express uses technology as a key part of its business strategy, it still wants to maintain complete control over its technology choices. Because we do not limit its options, Federal Express chose Sybase. "
Doc2262,sybase ,1996," To provide the greatest customer service and to maximize revenue, Sybase??s sales and marketing organizations are focusing on those vertical m a rkets where a competitive edge depends on implementing high-performance information technology. We have expanded our expertise in particular industries, such as finance, banking, insurance, telecommunications, healthcare, energy, and media and entertainment. "
Doc2263,sybase ,1996," Someone recently asked me if Sybase was a technology company or a solutions company. I answered, ??Both.?? I believe that to be successful, Sybase must be a leading technology company. But customers do not just buy technology for technology??s sake; they buy it to solve business problems. Our job is to create world-leading technology and then help customers solve realworld problems with that technology. "
Doc2264,sybase ,1996," With this in mind, Sybase has significantly strengthened its partnerships with application developers and systems integrators so that we can furnish Sybase customers with complete solutions to their real-world business challenges. We now have more than 2,000 Open Solutions?? partners worldwide. "
Doc2265,sybase ,1996," Sybase??s Professional Services organization continues to work together with customers to implement end-to-end solutions. We offer a complete range of services from business process engineering and organizational consulting to information architecture design, deployment, and application support. In 1996, the number of Sybase consulting engagements increased significantly, and revenue from Sybase Worldwide Consulting Services and maintenance fees increased 19 percent to become 40 percent of the company??s total 1996 revenue, up from 36 percent in 1995. "
Doc2266,sybase ,1996," This definition of our focus protecting customers?? freedom of choice by providing open, flexible computing solutions is helping us determine where to concentrate research and development resources. Today, our middleware connectivity and high-speed access products lead the market. Powersoft?? application development tools from Sybase are the industry??s leading database design and development tools. Sybase SQL Anywhere?? has seen remarkable growth as it provides distributed database technology to the mobile computing market. And we are working very hard to regain our technological leadership in database technology as well. In fact, our database products have already scored better independently audited performance benchmark results than those of our competitors. In 1997, we plan to concentrate on three other technology areas: Internet-based transaction processing; data warehousing; and Java-enabled computing. "
Doc2267,sybase ,1996," First, we see the Internet as the logical extension of a distributed architecture. NetImpact,?? Sybase??s open strategy for transaction-based applications over the Internet, includes many d i fferent Sybase products. What sets our NetImpact strategy apart from other database vendors?? Internet strategies is that NetImpact relies on open standard Internet and component technologies and avoids proprietary platform extensions. "
Doc2268,sybase ,1996," Second, our WarehouseNOW?? strategy offers customers the immediate advantages of decision support, with less cost and complexity than typically associated with consolidation warehouse projects. Sybase I Q?? h a s already established itself as the performance leader and fastest growing database for use with analytic data marts. Sybase IQ provides the query power that enables the deployment of data marts, which dramatically reduce the costs to build and support data warehouse applications. These data marts allow people to make faster and more accurate business decisions. "
Doc2269,sybase ,1996," Third, while our competitors tout their object-oriented technology, only Sybase offers end-to-end objects that can reside not just in a database but in middleware and tools as well. For example, Sybase will introduce Java not simply as a language suited for client applets but also for middleware on transaction and application servers, and even as an object-oriented standardized language in the database. "
Doc2270,sybase ,1996," In addition to our technology and services, another aspect that sets Sybase apart is the commitment of our employees to developing Sybase??s competitive advantages, delivering superior products, controlling costs, and differentiating the benefits of our products in the m a rket. And above all, we are committed to being responsive to our customers, ensuring that all of them can use Sybase products and services to their greatest advantage. "
Doc2271,sybase ,1996," As evidence of our new dedication, I want to tell you about my recent experiences when I walked through a major information systems industry show. What I saw was that Sybase products, technologies, and people are truly distinctive. I suggest you take a look for yourself. You??ll see that this company is more focused and doing what it does extremely well. Sybase is clearly defining itself in the marketplace through its commitment to providing customers with open, flexible computing solutions. "
Doc2272,sybase ,1996," In closing, I would like to thank Mark Hoffman, who has been extremely supportive of the company??s management transition during the latter half of the year. "
Doc2273,sybase ,1996, I appreciate your trust and confidence and look forward to a successful 1997. 
Doc2274,sybase ,1997,"When Mitchell Kertzman brought me on board August 1, 1997, Sybase had already announced its new Adaptive Component Architecture and the Company had begun expanding and upgrading all its product lines accordingly. Our success in returning Sybase to technological leadership fulfilled one of Mitchell??s primary goals for the year. And this achievement will serve as a solid basis for continued progress in 1998. "
Doc2275,sybase ,1997," Sybase is well positioned to build on our strengths in data warehouse, Web, and occasionally connected computing. We have superior technology for each of these markets and we will integrate that technology into complete solutions which include partner products along with our professional services and support offerings. Practically every company I talk to wants help in one or more of these areas, because they need the competitive differentiation these new modes of computing can provide. "
Doc2276,sybase ,1997," Data warehouses, for example, are typically used to extract meaningful information from the mountains of customer transaction data sitting in corporate databases. With a data warehouse, it??s much easier for organizations to sort through that data and learn what customers want and how to provide it. "
Doc2277,sybase ,1997," Web computing   that is, computing done over the Internet??s World Wide Web   has created a tremendous opportunity for companies to give their customers, vendors, and partners better access to information systems. This includes quick and inexpensive access to strategic data. It also allows companies to advertise and sell products in a vast, global market place. Using the same technology, organizations can provide better, more timely information internally to their employees. "
Doc2278,sybase ,1997," Occasionally connected computing offers a way for companies to keep their sales forces and branch offices in touch with corporate data resources. Sales and service professionals increasingly use laptops and other devices to connect with their corporate network on an as-needed basis, and Sybase offers the leading software technology to move up-to-the-minute information such as pricing, products, and order status onto the remote users?? equipment. This is how growing organizations are beginning to maximize sales productivity, while remaining close to their customers in the field. "
Doc2279,sybase ,1997," These three technology strengths are the foundation for Sybase??s strategy to deliver customer- focused solutions. In order to achieve our goals to increase profitability and grow license revenue, the Company will focus in 1998 on delivering improvements in marketing, sales, distribution, consulting services, and support which will build on this foundation. My primary goal is to coordinate all these activities so we can more effectively solve our customers?? business problems. "
Doc2280,sybase ,1997," As customers turn to Sybase for complete solutions in these areas, they require expertise in services and support as well as excellent technology. Today, Sybase??s robust and established professional consulting organization helps customers design, implement, and manage enterprise information systems. This professional services expertise, along with our continued focus on providing world-class support, will be a cornerstone for our solutions sales efforts in 1998. "
Doc2281,sybase ,1997," Partners are another important element in our overall solutions approach. Unlike many of our competitors who themselves compete with their partners, Sybase??s solutions strategy in 1998 will build on the strong partner relationships we have developed over the years. We recently reorganized our partner support plans to better leverage our resources to meet the needs of our most important partners, while nurturing the growth of new business with emerging firms. "
Doc2282,sybase ,1997," Finally, sales productivity remains key in our overall strategy to grow the Company. Before the end of 1997 we began increasing the number of direct selling positions in our sales force, mostly by converting people from sales support roles to quota-driven responsibilities. In early 1998, we chartered a new group focused on creating new customer relationships. These two changes are designed to help us simultaneously win new business and take better care of existing customers. "
Doc2283,sybase ,1997," We made great progress in restoring Sybase to competitive strength in 1997. Now we need to leverage that strength to start growing revenue again. I believe that 1998 will be an exciting year for Sybase. Along with Mitchell Kertzman, our CFO Jack Acosta, and other members of our management team, I look forward to reporting our results to you next year. "
Doc2284,sybase ,1998,"1998 was an extraordinary year of transition for Sybase. I am happy to report that we closed the year with our third consecutive quarter of positive operating earnings before cost of restructuring. Our sustained operating profitability came as a result of the highly focused management of our assets and expenses.We generated cash in each of the last three quarters and thus substantially improved our balance sheet. And we not only demonstrated good fiscal management in 1998; we also introduced a new business strategy, a new sales methodology, and a fresh set of products mapped to market-focused initiatives. In addition, we launched four new business divisions to carry our strategy forward into 1999 and beyond. "
Doc2285,sybase ,1998," I??d like to explain our new strategy and share with you my goals. Last year, our executive leaders, sales force, and product teams embarked on a bold plan to solidify Sybase??s technologies and professional service capabilities around key growth markets. As a result, Sybase created four major divisions to pursue opportunities within four multibillion-dollar markets?Business Intelligence, Mobile and Embedded Computing, Enterprise Solutions, and Internet Applications. "
Doc2286,sybase ,1998," In order to attract a larger share of these markets, we have modified Sybase??s sales strategy in two important ways. First, we are concentrating a higher degree of focus on our top customers.We have retooled our enterprise business, rolling out a high-touch, integrated selling model directed at fewer than 1,000 named accounts. This approach is intended to generate more license revenue, and will allow us to create stronger customer intimacy as we leverage Sybase assets in products, services, and vertical expertise to support these customers. Second, we are working toward greater coverage in the marketplace. Each of our new divisions is empowered to form its own distribution channel coordinated under a corporate program. Each division will be responsible for identifying, recruiting, and developing partners and channels to provide the domain expertise needed to enhance coverage within each target market. "
Doc2287,sybase ,1998," As the divisions increase their accountability to their customer and prospect bases, they will also help Sybase strengthen its identity as a vertical solutions provider, not simply a provider of software infrastructure. Sybase has long been committed to delivering Information Anywhere?? which means we??re making our customers more competitive by enabling them to get closer to their own customers. Home banking, straight-through processing, agent automation, and improved medical records access are just a few examples of how Sybase technology allows our customers to reach this goal.We remain committed to this vision for the competitive, expanded enterprise, and are aligning ourselves more closely with the vertical markets seeking the strategic advantages we offer. Here is what that means for each division. "
Doc2288,sybase ,1998," While dedicated to providing superior enterprise computing technology, the Enterprise Solutions Division will concentrate on developing more services-led sales for our database and middleware product offerings. Banks, for example, are turning to Sybase for complete solutions in risk management and leveraging our professional services expertise along with our market-leading middleware technology. Early this year, our Business Intelligence Division acquired Data Warehouse Network Limited, a company whose knowledge management applications complement Sybase technology in a variety of vertical industries, including retail banking, telecommunications, healthcare, insurance, and public utilities. The Internet Applications Division is moving into several vertical markets with its new Enterprise Application Server??, which has already generated enthusiasm in the financial marketplace as the foundation for the new Sybase Financial Server??. And Sybase??s Mobile and Embedded Computing Division is widely recognized as the leader in small footprint and fingerprint databases for laptops, handheld computing devices and pagers, and intelligent appliances. Recently, this division has seen tremendous progress with telecommunication and banking partners, as well as healthcare, the public sector, and retail markets. "
Doc2289,sybase ,1998," As we approach the year 2000, we are beginning to see more customers consider the value-added aspects of IT, and we expect to see customers in our traditional core markets refocus on their software investments. Our banking customers are, for the most part, attempting to resolve their Y2K compliance issues by mid-year 1999, and I believe that refocused spending on new applications will begin to expand into exciting new opportunities for us. "
Doc2290,sybase ,1998," As we prepare to seize these and other opportunities, we will rely ever more strongly on our partner base to help us achieve our new goals. Already, we have moved beyond the model of the last decade where the offering, typically, was technology for technology??s sake. Instead, we are addressing our customers?? real business challenges, which is where our new and existing partner relationships play such a vital role.We are able to deliver more complete business solutions because our partners?? products, services, and years of targeted expertise round out Sybase??s own capabilities. "
Doc2291,sybase ,1998," It was particularly gratifying to see strong growth in the database arena toward the end of 1998, and we??re building on our momentum by pursuing new market opportunities and extending our traditional enterprise software offerings. I am committed, as my number one priority, to increase the bottom-line value of Sybase for our shareholders, so that our stock price begins to more accurately reflect what our company is worth. This is my primary responsibility. I truly believe the groundwork has been laid, and that 1999 will be a year of profitable growth for our company. "
Doc2292,sybase ,1999,"I am pleased to report that 1999 was the second most profitable year in Sybase??s history, an achievement that was particularly gratifying in that it marked the return of the company to solid profitability after three difficult years. Our financial results speak for themselves: Sybase is indeed back.With a renewed operational and vertical market focus, and a cash-generation strategy that has created capital for acquisitions and other investments, we now have the resources and the credibility we need to move aggressively in pursuing substantial opportunities for growth in the years ahead. "
Doc2293,sybase ,1999," For the year ended December 31, 1999, Sybase reported revenues of $871.6 million, compared to revenues of $867.5 million in 1998. Net income for the year was $62.5 million, or $0.76 per share, compared to a net loss in the previous year of $93.1 million, or $1.15 per share. The company ended the year with a cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments balance of $352.9 million, up 41 percent from 1998. "
Doc2294,sybase ,1999," During 1999, Sybase successfully executed the second chapter of a three-phase plan put in place in 1998. In that ?? chapter one?? year, we created the four divisions in which the company is now organized.We also developed a financial model and operational strategy to stabilize Sybase and turn its prospects around. In 1999, we took step two, successfully returning to profitability and, once again, generating the cash needed to invest in the company??s future. "
Doc2295,sybase ,1999," Our overall results are largely a function of the success on the part of everyone at Sybase in increasing operational efficiency. During 1999, we succeeded in reducing costs of the company??s revenue, while improving our productivity.We exited unprofitable businesses, operations, and offices around the world.We reduced overhead and spending and streamlined our workforce. Perhaps most important of all, we reorganized from within to create higher levels of accountability and sharpen our vertical market focus  all designed to optimize the core competencies that differentiate Sybase in the marketplace. "
Doc2296,sybase ,1999," These efforts yielded substantial and measurable results. Although Sybase??s revenues were virtually flat in 1999 compared to the previous year, the company??s bottom line underwent a dramatic transformation.We progressed from losing more than $90 million in 1998 to earning more than $60 million last year  a swing of over $150 million.We??re very proud of this accomplishment, and we believe it sets the stage for even better things to come. "
Doc2297,sybase ,1999," The year ahead represents the third chapter in Sybase??s strategy: namely, to return to revenue growth.We enter 2000 with a very strong balance sheet and profitable operations for generating the cash to invest in sales, marketing, and product development activities. "
Doc2298,sybase ,1999," From this platform, we plan to aggressively target three areas of growth. First, in the emerging enterprise portal market, we intend to be the preeminent supplier of e-Business software infrastructure solutions. Second, in the mobile and embedded technology market, we intend to further solidify and strengthen our leadership position. Third, in vertical markets, we intend to multiply our offerings of end-to-end solutions for fast-growing, fast-changing industries. "
Doc2299,sybase ,1999," Acquisitions will continue to play an important role in our strategy, particularly in its focus on verticals. During 1999, for example, we took important steps in this direction by making a 30 percent equity investment in Demica, a United Kingdom-based provider of sophisticated bank trading systems, and by acquiring Home Financial Network, Inc. (HFN), an Internet financial services company. The latter acquisition is notable in that we have combined HFN with Sybase??s Financial Server business to create a wholly owned subsidiary, called Financial Fusion, Inc., that is targeted specifically at the financial services market. This move is in keeping with our ongoing strategy of providing e-Business solutions for our current four vertical markets of expertise: financial services, telecommunications and media, healthcare, and government. These markets  and Sybase??s activities in them  are discussed in more detail in the following section of this year??s annual report. "
Doc2300,sybase ,1999," In summary, 1999 was an excellent year for Sybase.We executed on our business objectives and successfully returned the company to solid profitability. I want to thank all of our stockholders, customers, partners  and especially our employees  for their support during what in recent years have been challenging times. Clearly, Sybase is back and is stronger than ever. Going forward and building on the credibility that our new management team has earned by fulfilling its 1999 business objectives, we intend to provide real value to the world of e-Business for many years to come. "
Doc2301,sybase ,2000,"I am delighted to report that 2000 was the most profitable year in our history. We kept our promises and exceeded expectations by pursuing a powerful e-Business strategy focused on enterprise portals, mobile and wireless solutions, and vertical markets three closely connected initiatives. As a result, Sybase enters 2001 strongly positioned to increase revenues, sustain profitability, and enhance our reputation as a visionary among global software companies. "
Doc2302,sybase ,2000," For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000, Sybase reported revenues of $960.5 million, a 10 percent increase over revenues of $871.6 million reported in 1999. Pro forma net income for the year was $115.5 million, or $1.25 per fully diluted share, a 67 percent increase over pro forma net income in the previous year of $69.0 million, or $0.82 per fully diluted share. Including restructuring credits and charges relating to acquisitions and other purchased intangibles, net income on a reported basis for fiscal year 2000 was $72.1 million, or $0.78 per fully diluted share, compared to $62.5 million, or $0.74 per fully diluted share in 1999. Sybase ended 2000 with a robust cash and cash equivalents balance of $355 million, up from $353 million in 1999. "
Doc2303,sybase ,2000," By the end of 2000, we successfully completed our initial three-year plan. In 1998, based on a new financial model and operational strategy, we reorganized the company into marketfocused divisions. In 1999, the benefits of this realignment were demonstrated as we returned to profitability and began generating cash needed for future investments. In 2000, we met our revenue growth target by aggressively pursuing the three initiatives mentioned above: enterprise portals, commonly known as ??EPs,?? which integrate information and applications for secure and personalized transactions over the Web; mobile and wireless solutions, which extend the enterprise to provide access anytime, anywhere; and vertical solutions, which run on top of our portals and are tailored for specific industries, communities, and markets. "
Doc2304,sybase ,2000," ENTERPRISE PORTALS In 2000, the Sybase EP platform not only attracted major new customers but also received prestigious awards and accolades. For example, the IT research and consulting firm, Gartner, Inc., listed us as a leading visionary in the enterprise portal market, while Intelligent Enterprise magazine gave us their reader??s choice award for ??Best Enterprise Information Portal?? software. "
Doc2305,sybase ,2000," MOBILE AND WIRELESS In the mobile and wireless arena, iAnywhere Solutions??, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary formed from our existing Mobile and Embedded Computing division won new partners, unveiled iAnywhere?? Wireless Server, launched a wireless ASP (application service provider) service, and garnered the ??Most Innovative Wireless Solution?? award at Giga??s Emerging Technology Scene conference. Capitalizing on our mobile market leadership, iAnywhere Solutions has employed the kind of business model and sales strategy that we believe is necessary to exploit new wireless opportunities. "
Doc2306,sybase ,2000," VERTICAL MARKETS In our targeted vertical markets, we continued to dominate financial services on Wall Street, and through Financial Fusion, Inc. another wholly owned subsidiary we attracted such major customers as American Express, ABN AMRO, Wells Fargo, Salomon Smith Barney, State Street Bank, and Bank of New York. "
Doc2307,sybase ,2000," Our other vertical market groups healthcare, telecommunications, and government posted significant wins and launched initiatives that are expected to flourish in both the near and the long term. "
Doc2308,sybase ,2000," PARTNERSHIPS The formation of key partnerships played an important role in last year??s growth. More than 30 companies joined the e-Portal Alliance to provide application solutions tailored to our enterprise portal products. Also partnering with us were Casio in the delivery of mobile e-Business solutions, EDS (Electronic Data Systems) in the design of analytic solutions, and Compudigm in the development of business intelligence solutions. "
Doc2309,sybase ,2000," iAnywhere Solutions was joined by Ericsson and Swedbank in developing ??always-available?? mobile banking solutions. Financial Fusion signed a master-reseller agreement with IBM that grants IBM premier partner status and leverages several groups within IBM to jointly sell, market, and further integrate Financial Fusion products. Moreover, through several joint partnerships with regional system integrators in Asia, we are further extending our reach into that key market. "
Doc2310,sybase ,2000," CUSTOMER SERVICE In recognition of our continuing commitment to customer satisfaction, the Software Support Professionals Association awarded our four North American support centers ??Support Center Practices Certification?? for the third consecutive year. For the second consecutive year, the Association of Service Professionals named MySybase our personalized Web portal one of the world??s ??Ten Best Web Support Sites.?? "
Doc2311,sybase ,2000," We added a financial solutions center in New York to our global solutions centers, which have blossomed to more than 2,000 classrooms in 45 countries. To further ensure accountability in Customer Care, each member of our executive management team has assumed personal responsibility for managing certain key accounts. "
Doc2312,sybase ,2000," what's ahead The company??s 2000 financial results validate our e-Business strategy of focusing on enterprise portals, mobile and wireless solutions, and key vertical markets. Looking ahead, we will seek competitive growth in all these areas. To further differentiate ourselves from the competition, we will work to enhance our portal offerings, evolving the Sybase Enterprise Portal into an even more robust platform a ??heavy-lifting?? infrastructure that supports every type of e-Business activity. To accelerate deployment of our e-Business platform solutions globally, we plan to devote additional resources to professional services and to partnering activities, including our long-term relationships with such organizations as EDS and PriceWaterhouseCoopers. "
Doc2313,sybase ,2000," In telecommunications and healthcare, we plan to make significant investments. In mobile and wireless markets, we are aiming to extend our leadership by following a model that has been applied so successfully in the financial services market. "
Doc2314,sybase ,2000," Beyond all else, we will strive to deliver stockholder value by continuing along a path of stable financial performance and earnings growth. I want to thank all of our employees, worldwide, for their hard work in making the past year such a success. On their behalf, I thank all of our stockholders, customers, and partners for their support in 2000 and, in advance, for their support of our effort to make 2001 even better. "
Doc2315,sybase ,2001,It was a challenging year. 
Doc2316,sybase ,2001," 2001 started with a slowdown in capital spending, followed by the dot.com collapse, the recession, and then the tragedy of September 11. "
Doc2317,sybase ,2001," Yet, in spite of these challenges, Sybase stayed on course, ended the year cash positive, and, in many ways, we found ourselves stronger than ever. "
Doc2318,sybase ,2001," In fact, I am proud to say we gained market share in our target segments, celebrated fifteen consecutive quarters of operating profitably on a pro forma basis*, and have raised our earnings per share estimates for 2002. "
Doc2319,sybase ,2001," Our pro forma net income* for 2001 was $96.6 million, total revenues were $926.1 million, and we ended the year with $343.2 million in cash and cash investments. "
Doc2320,sybase ,2001," We also made substantial investments: completing a new corporate headquarters, buying back $107 million in shares of our common stock, and issuing $339.3 million in stock to acquire New Era of Networks, Inc., which strengthened our business portfolio. "
Doc2321,sybase ,2001," Of course, the numbers are only one measure of our performance. "
Doc2322,sybase ,2001," In a year where others were led by circumstance, we stayed on plan and delivered on our strategy. "
Doc2323,sybase ,2001," Since 1998, our plan has been to focus our portfolio on highest-growth opportunities: e-Business infrastructure solutions, m-Business (mobile solutions), and v-Business (vertical solutions). "
Doc2324,sybase ,2001," Throughout this report, you??ll be reading about how these three lines of business have contributed to the Sybase bottom line. "
Doc2325,sybase ,2001, We have been successful in these areas for a variety of reasons. 
Doc2326,sybase ,2001," Most notably, our technology. "
Doc2327,sybase ,2001, Another is our business strategy itself. It has proved to be both solidly grounded and agile enough to adapt to rapidly changing environments. 
Doc2328,sybase ,2001," Yet another is our experienced management team, which has shown that it has the ability to manage through tough times and hard decisions. "
Doc2329,sybase ,2001," Finally, nothing has contributed more to our success than our employees. As a group and as individuals, they have demonstrated their motivation and dedication to our customers no matter what the challenge. "
Doc2330,sybase ,2001," I believe these are the assets that allowed us to take a very, very challenging year and turn it into a success story. "
Doc2331,sybase ,2001," In a year, when many only saw reduced markets, we saw opportunity. "
Doc2332,sybase ,2001," On the strength of our technology, our customer base, and our balance sheet, we made advances in the U.S. and abroad in spite of the global economic downturn. "
Doc2333,sybase ,2001," Our positive operating cash flow allowed us to acquire new technologies without external financing. And we continued to enlarge our footprint in Asia by winning several major contracts in China, Korea, and Japan. "
Doc2334,sybase ,2001," In a year where many lost their footing, we solidified our position and poised ourselves for the future. "
Doc2335,sybase ,2001," Our brand became increasingly important in 2001. We made the move to the New York Stock Exchange and laid the foundations for moving our corporate headquarters to Dublin, California, which we completed in 2002. Both moves signaled the positive momentum of our business, our strategy, and our brand. Moreover, we continued to strengthen customer retention and satisfaction, ending the year with an 89% rating in customer support satisfaction worldwide. "
Doc2336,sybase ,2001," Clearly the plan is working, and we intend to stay on course. "
Doc2337,sybase ,2001," Our focus will remain on integration the integration of people and business processes on the Internet, of business processes and enterprise infrastructures, and of real-time mobile and wireless messaging in traditionally-static environments. Additionally, we will continue to enhance our core database technologies, extend our open infrastructure and solutions, identify new market opportunities, and capitalize on new ideas. "
Doc2338,sybase ,2001," Most importantly, we??ll continue integrating our customers?? needs with every aspect of our business and our personal behavior. "
Doc2339,sybase ,2001," On that note, I would like to extend my thanks to each and every one of our employees. They made it possible for me to deliver a report filled with so many significant accomplishments and new milestones in these challenging times. "
Doc2340,sybase ,2001," I could not be more proud of our people, our management, or our technologies. I look forward to a very exciting 2002. "
Doc2341,sybase ,2002,We look back on this year and see many reasons to look forward with renewed optimism and enthusiasm. 
Doc2342,sybase ,2002," In 2002, we stayed on course, on strategy, and on target. "
Doc2343,sybase ,2002," We managed with stability and consistency and once again delivered a strong financial performance. In an environment that challenged everyone, we performed better than most. "
Doc2344,sybase ,2002, We managed margins and continued to generate cash. 
Doc2345,sybase ,2002," We generated $164.3 million in operating cash flow for the year, our total revenues were $829.9 million, and we ended the year with $392.8 million in cash and cash investments. "
Doc2346,sybase ,2002," In the last year, we improved our operational efficiencies. Through the use of our own technologies, such as the Sybase Enterprise Portal, we are realizing the same cost savings and efficiencies that have been winning us customer engagements in the private and public sectors. "
Doc2347,sybase ,2002, We also added several key executives while retaining key members of the current management team. This speaks strongly to the stability that has made Sybase successful. 
Doc2348,sybase ,2002," Along with our key executives, we enjoyed another year of extremely high customer retention and high customer satisfaction. Yet, the customer view of Sybase is evolving. "
Doc2349,sybase ,2002," In addition to our traditional strengths in database technologies and development tools, customers now look to us as a key player in integration middleware. The need to increase efficiencies, reduce cost, and see a real return on IT investments continues to make integration a key driver of the IT agenda. The USA PATRIOT Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and other government compliance mandates are driving enormous integration projects. "
Doc2350,sybase ,2002," We also continue to invest in and expand our portal, mobile, and financial applications, as well as healthcare technologies. These solutions help customers realize just how much more Sybase has to deliver. Thanks to our acquisition of AvantGo in early 2003, we now offer one of the world??s largest mobile applications, with more than 8 million registered users. "
Doc2351,sybase ,2002," The success of these technologies has allowed us to grow the presence of our brand worldwide. In 2002, we enjoyed the honor of being named ??Most Successful Database Company in China?? by the China Center for Information Industry Development. We are now the second largest database company in the People??s Republic of China and the world??s leading mobile database supplier, with more than a 70% market share. "
Doc2352,sybase ,2002," These successes have contributed to Sybase??s reputation as a global thought leader. In the last year, Sybase built relationships with important organizations, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the World Economic Forum, the Information Technology Association of America, the Business Software Alliance, and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. "
Doc2353,sybase ,2002," We recognize that no organization succeeds alone. In 2002, Sybase did much to improve the strength, diversity, and footprint of our ecosystem. We laid the groundwork for the future with new partnerships with PeopleSoft, BearingPoint, Sun Microsystems, Apple Computer, and SGI. We??ve also made strategic investments in Linux. "
Doc2354,sybase ,2002, Our plan is working. We are strongly positioned for the future. 
Doc2355,sybase ,2003,"The fundamental promise of information technology better information,faster remains the key driver behind technology innovation and investment.Whatis evolving is the way new technologies are delivering on this promise and transforming the core business models of corporations around the world.We call this evolution the Unwired Enterprise,and no company is in a stronger position to deliver its extraordinary advantages than Sybase. "
Doc2356,sybase ,2003," While technology evolves,we continue to leverage a consistentand solid strategy:developing leading enterprise software solutions,delivering value to our customers,and achieving solid financial results year after year. "
Doc2357,sybase ,2003," We further strengthened our expertise in data management and integration technology, and continued our market leadership in mobile database and middleware. With these and other strengths, we are helping companies worldwide make enterprise information more accessible and get it into their professionals?? hands anywhere, anytime, on any platform. We are helping unleash the potential of the Unwired Enterprise. "
Doc2358,sybase ,2003," In 2003, we delivered positive earnings, balance sheet performance, and stockholder value, as evidenced by the 53 percent increase in our share price year-over-year just over twice the increase of the S&P 500. Despite continued weakness in IT spending, we saw refocused energy on strategic IT investments and new order activity as the year ended. "
Doc2359,sybase ,2003," We are optimistic about our continuous innovation and product performance, our industry-leading strategies to capture greater market share in the mobile and wireless markets, and our ability to deliver value and grow our business worldwide. "
Doc2360,sybase ,2003," During 2003, we generated net cash from operating activities of $202.1 million, and had $573.8 million in cash, cash equivalents, and cash investments on December 31, 2003 the highest in our history. We have no long-term debt. "
Doc2361,sybase ,2003," SYBASE??S MARKET VISION: ENABLING THE UNWIRED ENTERPRISE As we celebrate our 20th year, we are well positioned with software solutions for information management, application development, and mobile and business solutions that address today??s most critical business need: moving information to the point of action. This is the Unwired Enterprise, and enabling it is our driving strategy for 2004 and beyond. As the economy recovers, we see our growth coming from companies?? urgent need to make real-time enterprise data, information, and applications accessible to the front lines, where most business decisions must be made. "
Doc2362,sybase ,2003," The first step is providing information liquidity across the enterprise. Our proven and extensive track record in information management, information access, application development, and integration solutions allows our customers to extract more value from their IT investments. Our solutions integrate and seamlessly deliver just about any type of data whether in a database, a transaction, or an application. Providing enterprise-wide information liquidity is a core Sybase strength. "
Doc2363,sybase ,2003," The second step is to access and use liquid information assets in new ways. Information must be delivered to the point of action, often through mobile technologies, so that professionals who work off the corporate campus and occasionally off the corporate network have the best information available whenever it??s required. Our mobility solutions extend our customers?? systems, allowing information to be easily accessed and to flow freely anywhere, anytime, on any platform. We are uniquely positioned to deliver an end- to-end mobile enterprise solution that includes everything from mobile databases, middleware, synchronization, and management software all the way to an industry-leading wireless portal, messaging, and ultralite-footprint databases. "
Doc2364,sybase ,2003," EXPANDING THE PARTNER ECOSYSTEM To further strengthen our offering, we have continued to build deep, collaborative relationships with other industry leaders. In 2003, we added several venerable companies to the roster, including Intel and SAP. We are partnering with Intel on multiple fronts, optimizing Sybase software on Intel processors and pushing initiatives and activities to accelerate the mass adoption of the Unwired Enterprise. With SAP, we are working to deliver integrated solutions for small and medium-size businesses. These are just two examples of the types of new relationships we have in place to extend our solutions further. "
Doc2365,sybase ,2003," TARGETING GLOBAL MARKETS We also continue to expand our focus on emerging markets outside of North America. We see growth opportunities around the world in China, in a rebounding Japanese market, and in the potential revival of Eastern Europe. "
Doc2366,sybase ,2003," BUILDING CATEGORY LEADERSHIP Through our consistent and conservative practices, Sybase has gained a reputation for integrity and credibility with investors, customers, and partners. We are proud of this status, along with our reputation for delivering continuous innovation, product performance, and stockholder value. "
Doc2367,sybase ,2003," We entered 2004 with great momentum, emerging as the category leader in software solutions to enable the Unwired Enterprise. We intend to build on our lead in the coming year with new solutions, expanded partnerships, and strategic investments that will strengthen our category leadership and provide decision makers everywhere with better information faster. "
Doc2368,sybase ,2003," We would like to thank our customers, partners, stockholders, and employees for their continued support in one of the most exciting and promising eras in our 20-year history. "
Doc2369,tibco ,1999,TIBCO??s first fiscal year as a public company has been an exciting one of accelerating growth and bright prospects for the future. 
Doc2370,tibco ,1999," My dream is to allow people to share information, and that??s the vision TIBCO follows in creating a flexible, constantly improving technology that allows businesses to use real-time information to make the best possible business decisions what we call The Power of Now. This means integrating and presenting disparate streams of internal and external information coherently to enable companies to make smarter business decisions faster, and to tie their customers, partners and vendors into those decisions. What we used to know as ??business?? has become ??eBusiness,?? and the focus on a software infrastructure that can deliver speed, integration and intelligent information has become a do-or-die obsession. "
Doc2371,tibco ,1999," The powerful forces at work among our customers play directly to TIBCO Software??s unique strengths. Companies now realize that becoming an eBusiness is absolutely essential for their survival, and as a result, the market for eBusiness infrastructure software is exploding. Last year, market analysts predicted approximately 50% growth in our sector. TIBCO Software??s revenues grew more than 80%, and we continue to increase our lead over competitors, who still offer only point solutions for specific problems. "
Doc2372,tibco ,1999," TIBCO, on the other hand, offers one-stop shopping for a complete eBusiness infrastructure. "
Doc2373,tibco ,1999," I like to measure our success in four areas: financial results, customers, partners, and products. "
Doc2374,tibco ,1999," Financial Results. On the financial front, total revenues for the fiscal year were $96 million. Up 83% over last year??s $53 million. It??s important to remember that TIBCO Software is only three years old and we??ve already achieved annual revenues of nearly 100 million dollars. I am not aware of any software company in history that has reached this level of revenue as quickly as TIBCO. "
Doc2375,tibco ,1999," Customers. We??ve continued to strengthen our position in key vertical markets including telecommunications, Internet eCommerce, manufacturing, energy and financial services. We started the year with fewer than 100 direct customers and more than tripled that number by adding about 200 new customers during the course of the year. On top of that, we have an installed base of more than 300 customers in the financial market. So, in total, roughly 600 companies are leveraging TIBCO??s products to run their businesses. "
Doc2376,tibco ,1999," Partners. TIBCO Software has a dream team of partners. During the year, we enhanced our existing partnerships and developed new relationships with industry leaders, especially in the business-to-business (B2B) eCommerce market, including Cisco, Oracle, Ariba, Selectica, Portal Software, KPMG, Andersen Consulting, Deloitte Consulting, SAP, Siebel Systems, Sybase, and i2 Technologies. "
Doc2377,tibco ,1999," Products. TIBCO Software??s first-class product offerings are the result of our extensive R & D investments and from the hard work of our engineers, whom I consider the best software engineers in the industry. As a result, during Fiscal 1999, we released more than two dozen products at a blistering pace. "
Doc2378,tibco ,1999," It??s fair to say that we set high goals for TIBCO in Fiscal 1999 and exceeded them. Our attitude, however, is not one of self-congratulation; rather, we are poised to react to and capitalize upon changing market and competitive conditions. A key strength of TIBCO over the years has been the flexibility and extensibility of our core belief that intelligent, real-time information The Power of Now creates a competitive advantage for our customers, and we intend to apply that belief as businesses evolve and change. "
Doc2379,tibco ,1999," TIBCO Software has developed what I believe to be the best technology and the finest roster of employees, customers, and partners in the industry. I am very optimistic about the years ahead. Thank you for your interest in and support of TIBCO Software. "
Doc2380,tibco ,2000,"Business is rapidly becoming e-business and TIBCO Software is at the heart of this revolution. Our e-business infrastructure software enables companies to integrate their business processes, extend their information assets, and connect over the Internet to a value web of partners, suppliers and customers. In short, we enable companies to profit from the New Economy by becoming efficient, real-time e-businesses. "
Doc2381,tibco ,2000," FISCAL 2000 HIGHLIGHTS In our fourth year as a company, TIBCO grew revenues to $252 million, over two-and-a-half times last year??s revenues of $96 million. We achieved pro-forma operating profit ahead of schedule, reaching approximately 16 percent in the fourth quarter. And, we doubled our direct and indirect customer base to more than 1,000 companies. Behind these numbers are significant achievements that enabled us to grow in fiscal 2000. During the year, TIBCO: "
Doc2382,tibco ,2000, Enhanced our product line to deliver the most comprehensive stack of e-business infrastructure software; 
Doc2383,tibco ,2000," Trained 5,500 customers and partners on our products; "

Doc2385,tibco ,2000," Strengthened our leadership in several key vertical markets including energy, telecommunications and manufacturing, and expanded into new ones, such as transportation and logistics, healthcare and retail "
Doc2386,tibco ,2000, Expanded our global presence by establishing sales operations in several new countries 
Doc2387,tibco ,2000," Underlying our revenue growth for the year was the addition of many new products. This helped increase license revenues to over 70 percent of overall revenues, up from 60 percent in 1999. Today, our end-to-end product offerings include four major product families: TIBCO ActiveEnterprise?? for application integration, business process automation and workflow; TIBCO ActivePortal?? for enterprise portal development and wireless access; TIBCO ActiveExchange?? for multi-party business-to-business commerce; and TIBCO Extensibility?? for advanced XML services. "
Doc2388,tibco ,2000," THE FUTURE IT??S ALL ABOUT TRUST Our goal for the future is simple to extend our leadership position as a supplier of e-business infrastructure software. Today, the market is at an important inflection point, having moved from early adopters to mainstream consumers of infrastructure software. That??s why our customers include many Fortune 1,000 companies. In this mainstream market environment trust becomes a key issue for prospects and customers. This plays to our greatest strengths: "
Doc2389,tibco ,2000, Our track record and experience; 
Doc2390,tibco ,2000, Our industrial-strength product offerings 
Doc2391,tibco ,2000, Our ecosystem of top-tier partners 
Doc2392,tibco ,2000," All of these qualities make us the most trusted choice for companies wanting to integrate, extend and connect their applications and information assets and thrive in the New Economy of the 21st Century. "
Doc2393,tibco ,2000," Today, companies know their success depends on the integration of all of their software technologies, including legacy, ERP and CRM applications and Internet-based services like B2B. TIBCO??s infrastructure software is the glue that ties these applications and systems together to create a value web of partners, suppliers and customers, resulting in an efficient, real-time e-business. So, whether it??s business-to-business, business-to-consumer, or business-toemployee, TIBCO??s infrastructure powers it. We like to say TIBCO enables B-to-whatever-you-want-it-to-be. "
Doc2394,tibco ,2000," In closing, I want to congratulate the 1,000 dedicated TIBCO employees for their extraordinary contributions. We have been able to attract and retain the most competent professionals in the industry and they are responsible for TIBCO??s growth and success. I look forward to reporting on our continued progress in the months and years ahead. Thank you for your continued support. "
Doc2395,tibco ,2001,"2001 was a challenging year for technology companies, but ultimately a successful year for TIBCO. We grew our business by more than 25%, and our business fundamentals remain strong our customers and partners are leaders in their industries, our technology is essential to our customers?? success, and our balance sheet is solid. "
Doc2396,tibco ,2001," My vision in founding TIBCO was to provide solutions that enable people to realize their dreams for their businesses. That??s what TIBCO??s business integration solutions are all about empowering companies to create stronger alliances, better serve their customers, and maximize their success. "
Doc2397,tibco ,2001," Today, business integration is among the most important investments a company can make in its future, which explains why ours is one of the fastest growing segments of the software industry. As the business integration leader, TIBCO will drive and capitalize on our segment??s projected growth. "
Doc2398,tibco ,2001, There are three fundamental trends driving this growth: 
Doc2399,tibco ,2001," Companies are using integration to unlock the full potential of past investments in ERP, CRM, and supply chain systems. Only through integration can companies achieve meaningful results and maximize their return on investment (ROI) from existing resources. "
Doc2400,tibco ,2001," Focus on the supply chain is shifting to the demand chain. Business integration gives companies the power to streamline the supply chain, the visibility to provide superior customer service, and the flexibility to respond more quickly to shifting customer demands. "
Doc2401,tibco ,2001," Industry-leading companies are constantly reinventing themselves by finding new ways to conduct business, new products and services to sell, and new ways to stay ahead of their markets. Integration enables companies to transform their businesses quickly seamlessly modifying business processes to add or remove systems, services, business units or partners as needs or opportunities arise. "
Doc2402,tibco ,2001," In 2001, TIBCO continued to gain momentum as we made business integration increasingly accessible to a wider range of companies throughout the world. It is gratifying to help a growing universe of companies embrace business integration and capitalize on these important trends. "
Doc2403,tibco ,2001," FISCAL 2001 HIGHLIGHTS For fiscal 2001, TIBCO??s revenues totaled $319 million, exceeding last year??s revenue of $252 million by 27%. Our license revenue grew to $217 million, comprising 68% of total revenue.

Doc2404,tibco ,2001," Despite significant macro-economic weakness in 2001, TIBCO was profitable on a pro forma basis every quarter, generating significant cash flow and enabling us to enter 2002 with a cash position of $677 million. "

Doc2437,tibco ,2003," THE FUTURE   Looking forward, tibco is well positioned as a leading enabler of real-time business out in front in terms of technology, innovation and experience. In 2004, we believe there are three key emerging trends that will drive the success of our business : "
Doc2438,tibco ,2003," The first trend is companies have made massive investmen in CRM. ERP and other systems that weren't designed to work together. TIBCO is increasingly being recognized as a catalyst that drives measurable improvements with these applications and systems. As companies make the connection between their system investments and realize their original goals in automating these systems, they begin to realize the power of real-time information and the power that TIBCO delivers . "
Doc2439,tibco ,2003," the second industry trend is the drive for improving internal processes. instead of data being the chief corporate asset, as was the case in the late 80s and throughout the 90, today's companies are now recognizing their business processes as their chief corporate asset and areas that can easily yield greater efficiency and improve overall operating performance. "
Doc2440,tibco ,2003," business process management (BPM) is creating increased demand for externalizing the business processes away from the applications, giving corporations the visibility and flexibility to improve their processes as the demands on their businesses change. "
Doc2441,tibco ,2003," and the third industry trend, and perhaps the most important, is an architectural shift from data at rest to data in motion. "
Doc2442,tibco ,2003, the 24x7 demands of business in the 21st century demand deep automation of decision-making since we no longer have the luxury of querying databases. making business decisions faster is no longer fast enough; they must be predictive in nature. these demands are leading a shift away from a database centric architecture- data at rest - to an information-bus based architecture that manages data in motion. 
Doc2443,tibco ,2003," this is the same concept that changed wall street in the 1980's. and now, it's how delta airlines uses, manages and adjusts flight schedules, re-routes customers and alerts food services when an unexpected event occurs. it enables harrah's resorts and casinos to completely change the face of customer service and loyalty making them the most profitable group in their market. this concept is now being adopted across a variety of industries from energy to entertainment. but enabling your business to be more flexible and predictive can't happen without an integration infrastructure based on proven products. TIBCO continues to be at the forefront of the integration market. "
Doc2444,tibco ,2003," in closing, I'd like to acknowledge and thank the continued hard work of our employees worldwide. my promise to you is that with our continued hard work, focus and dedication to making customers successful, 2004 will be a very rewarding year. "
