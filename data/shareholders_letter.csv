Doc1,Adobe ,1996,"For Adobe, 1996 was a year of building toward future growth in a rapidly changing industry. We are pleased to have put in place new market initiatives, technology directions, and organizational changes that position us to take full advantage of long-term opportunities, while achieving solid financial results. In 1996, revenue reached $786.6 million, and reported net income totaled $153.3 million, or $2.04 per share, compared with 1995 revenue of $762.3 million, net income of $93.5 million, and earnings per share of $1.26. These figures resulted both from normal recurring operations and from substantial returns on the company's venture investment program. Normalized net income for 1996-excluding expenses from divested or discontinued businesses and net gains from external investments-totaled $128.2 million, compared with $135.6 million in 1995, while earnings per share were $1.71, compared with $1.80.  During 1996, the company declared cash dividends on its common stock totaling $0,20 per share. We repurchased 3.3 million shares of common stock during the year, offsetting dilution from expected issuances under our employee stock plans. At year end, the number of outstanding shares of common stock totaled 71.5 million. Our financial position remains strong, with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances of $564.1 million.  Adobe's investment program, which includes Adobe Ventures L.P., direct investments, and other activities, annually introduces us to hundreds of innovative companies that are strategic to our software business. The program gives us a window on emerging technologies and markets, and funds companies that make a broader set of products and services available to our customers. Now three years old, the venture investment program generated significant returns in 1996, primarily because several companies in our portfolio-most notably Netscape Communications-made public stock offerings. The returns from these activities are funding internal development programs, further external investments, and other corporate initiatives. Revenue from the licensing of Adobe PostScript and other printing technologies reached $196.7 million, compared with the $183.4 million posted in 1995. This growth reflects increased shipments of color printers, Japanese printers, and implementations of the Configurable PostScript Interpreter (CPSI). In all, Adobe delivered more than 300 implementations of PostScript technology this year. The next generation of our founding technology, Adobe Postscript Level 3 software is designed to meet the printing needs of Internet users. We are working with our more than 70 OEM customers to deliver Postscript Level 3 solutions in the second half of 1997 Our new Adobe PrintGear architecture dramatically improves the quality and performance of low-cost printers for the fast-growing small officel/home office market. The first OEM product to include PrintGear technology, the NEC Superscript 860 monochrome laser printer, launched midyear and has won more than 17 industry awards. We expect PrintGear technology to ship in color inkjet printers in 1997.  For on-demand digital printing in commercial and corporate settings, Adobe has developed a new production printing architecture code-named Supra. Already, more than 30 OEM customers are supporting this architecture, with IBM demonstrating the first production printing system in October. Several manufacturers are scheduled to ship similar products in 1997. Application products revenue rose to $589.9 million, compared with $578.9 million in 1995. Strong revenue from our major graphics applications indicates that our strategy of developing tightly integrated products with common features and functionality is appealing to customers. We released new versions of many key applications, including Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Acrobat, Adobe FrameMaker+SGML, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe PageMill. A new version of Adobe PageMaker began shipping in early fiscal 1997. We also delivered entirely new products such as Adobe PhotoDeluxe, a digital imaging program based on Adobe Photoshop and aimed at consumers. The shipment of Adobe Photoshop 4.0 was our first simultaneous, cross-platform product release. In a two-week period, we delivered Windows and Macintosh versions At Adobe, we are committed to offering cross-platform implementations of our application products, giving users maximum choice and compatibility. Today we are capitalizing quickly on new opportunities in the Windows market. Having already incorporated full Windows 95 support into our applications, we now are collaborating with hardware manufacturers and other third parties to deliver powerful, creative capabilities to users of the Windows NT operating system. Adobe products such as Photoshop and PhotoDeluxe, for example, are among the first to support the Intel MMX processor, which optimizes image-handling speeds. New versions of Adobe FrameMaker and Adobe PageMaker include support for symmetric multiprocessing computers and other performance-enhancing features. Additional Windows NT product upgrades are scheduled to enter the market in 1997, aided by worldwide advertising and promotional campaigns. In light of these activities, revenue from Adobe products for the Windows platform continued to rise in 1996, now representing approximately 40 percent of our total product revenue. We expect this upward trend to continue. In just a few years, Adobe has come to offer the broadest, most popular set of tools for creating content on the World Wide Web. We have so effectively integrated Internet features into our established product line, in fact, that applications such as Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator consistently lead industry polls identifying favorite Web authoring software. At the same time, a new Macintosh version of Adobe PageMill, which is designed expressly for the Web, has quickly achieved best-in-class status in its emerging category. Files preserved in Adobe's Portable Document format (PDF) have proliferated on Web sites of all kinds. To access those files, Internet users can download the Adobe Acrobat Reader 6ree from our Web site and other sites. So far, more than 10 million users-some 20,000 a daychave taken us up on the offer. Acrobat is the fastest, easiest way to generate documents for distribution on the Web, corporate intranets, and CD-ROMs. It is reaching critical mass in publishing firms, government agencies, and other businesses, and smoothing the path of everyone from students to CEOs into the world of electronic communication. Adobe continues to adapt its organization to meet changing technologies and customer needs. In 1996, we divided our operations into five business units that can focus more closely on emerging and fast-growth markets, while continuing to expand opportunities for established product lines. We also added key members to our executive team. Our senior vice president of marketing oversees a consolidated worldwide marketing organization, A new chief financial and administrative officer joined us during the fourth quarter, and a new senior vice president and general manager of the Graphics Division came on board in December 1996.

Doc2,Adobe ,1997,"Ideas can be powerful things. But only if you can make them compelling, express them clearly, and communicate them directly to those you want to affect. As technology transforms the way the world experiences information, people in businesses and homes everywhere face the same challenges in creating and distributing their ideas. How can I make my message stand out??? ??How can I get it to look just the way I want Can I deliver ilfaster and more easily Adobe provides solutions to these challenges: solutions that let everyone turn ideas into reality exactly as envisioned.  In 1997, Adobe's objective was to deliver solutions and expand its customer base. We accomplished this goal by attracting new users and meeting their needs with integrated solutions and standards. We leveraged our core technologies to create new products. And we invested in strengthening a foundation on which to build in 1998. As we extended our reach to new markets, we maintained solid financial performance In fiscal year 1997, Adobe achieved revenue growth of 16 percent and reported net income growth of 22 percent. Revenue reached a record $912 million, with reported net income also a record at $187 million. Revenue from application products was a record $716 million, compared with $590 million in fiscal 1996, while our licensing revenue was level with 1996 figures. During 1997, Adobe declared cash dividends on its common stock totaling $0.20 per share, and repurchased more than 6 million shares of common stock, offsetting dilution from issuances under our employee stock option and stock purchase plans and reducing the actual number of shares outstanding. Adobe overall financial position is strong, with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances of $503 million and no long-term debt, as of our fiscal year-end on November 28,1997 In 1997, Adobe relationship with our key customer base, professional designers, remained strong, while a new class of users increasingly turned to our applications for the power to make ideas compelling. Customer research indicates that the number of corporate users of Adobe graphics applications is increasing impressively The result was outstanding sales. Application products revenue climbed 21 percent in 1997. The growth of the Web fueled revenue from Adobe graphics applications. indeed, as Adobe continues to integrate and expand the Web capabilities of our product line. customers increasingly use our tools to create graphics and deliver documents for the Internet. Adobe has continued to attract customers by tightly integrating its graphics products into a virtual suite. For example, we have added consistent features, user interfaces, and functionality to Adobe Photoshop Adobe Illustrator. and Adobe PageMaker to form an online and print publishing solution that competitors with only a single product offering simply cannot match. Particularly notable was Adobe??s growth on the Windows platform. In 1996. Adobe made simultaneous cross-platform product releases a priority in 1997, for the first time, revenue from Windows platform products exceeded that from the Macintosh platform. Windows products accounted for 51 percent of application products revenue (excluding platform-independent and UNIX products), with 49 percent going to Macintosh products. On a year-over-year basis, application products revenue on the Windows platform grew 64 percent. Shipments of Adobe illustrator 7.0 in 1997 demonstrate the company??s success in making graphics a priority for Windows users. Adobe illustrator 7.0 became the best- selling cross-platform desktop illustration application in the U.S. Sales of Adobe illustrator for Windows pushed Adobe??s cross-platform retail unit sales beyond 50 percent of the entire US desktop illustration software market for the rest of fiscal 1997. NASA's Mars Pathfinder The informntion-rich Mars Pathfinder Web site attracted millions of earthbound visitors daily during the summer 1997 mission. NASA??s jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) used Adobe PageMill Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Acrobat software to rapidly provide images and other data to those following the expedition online. With AdobeAcrobat, we didn't have to reauthor materials to get them readyfor the Web. says Rich Pavlovslty, JPL Webmaster Our printing business faces challenges and opportunlties. The past year was challenging for our printing technologies, the primary source of our licensing revenue. We launched Adobe PostScript 3,?? the next generation of the world-standard printing technology primed to meet the needs of Internet-based, distributed printing environments. With IBM, we announced the first on-demand digital printing system based on Adobe PostScript Extreme the lBM InfoPrint 4000, which prints at speeds exceeding 1,000 pages per minute. And products based on Adobe PrintGear the architecture that dramatically improves the quality and performance of low-cost printers for small offices, home offices, and workgroups continue to garner awards and acclaim. Despite these accomplishments, revenue from the licensing of Adobe PostScript and other printing technologies reached $196 million, effectively level with $197 million in 1996. The year-to-year flatness is the result of a number of factors affecting our original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers, primarily in the Japanese and Macintosh markets. We continue to evaluate ways to better communicate the value of Adobe PostScript and serve our customers?? needs in a distribute-then-print world. Adobe makes digltal workflows a reality for enterprises. In 1997, Adobe led the industry in enabling digital workflows, a revolutionary trend that we expect to accelerate in the coming year. Digital workflow a streamlined publishing process, independent of hardware, computing platforms, and applications lets businesses create compelling content once and then easily publish both in print and on the Web, instead of duplicating efforts and reauthoring using separate, expensive systems for different media, thus saving time and money. Adobe solutions are the foundation for an efficient digital workflow. Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), for example, is increasingly being adopted worldwide as a de facto standard format for Internet document publishing. The number of copies of free Adobe Acrobat Reader software Adobe has distributed shot past the 20 million mark in 1997. PDF generation is integrated into many Adobe authoring applications such as Adobe Illustrator 7.0, Adobe Photoshop 4.0, and Adobe PageMaker 6.5. Bosch Automation Technology, a division of Robert Bosch GMbH, Germany and one of the worlds leading manufacturers of mechanical components, uses Adobe Acrobat software for electronic document distribution. Bosch chose Adobe Enterprise Publishing Services (formerly Digidox Document Solutions), a subsidiary of Adobe, to convert thousands of pages of printed technical and marketing materials to Portable Document Format (PDF) files. Bosch customers, sales personnel, and distributors benefit from having voluminous information accessible and searchable on CD-ROM and the Bosch Web site. Adobe FrameMaker?? 5.5, the new version of our publishing solution for complex, mission-critical documents, enables digital workflows by allowing users to output to PDF, HTML, SGML, or Adobe PostScript formats-all from a single source file. ln addition, with Adobe Acrobat 3.0 software for converting virtually any computer-generated file to PDF, the newly released Acrobat Capture?? 2.0 software for bringing legacy paper documents into PDF, and PDF-based Adobe PostScript 3 printing systems, enterprises can go from creation to output using PDF as a media-independent digital master, dramatically reducing the chances for errors and delays. It??s not only designers and users in enterprises who need power to make their ideas stand out. We have created fiexible, easy-to-use products tailored especially for the needs of new customers in homes and offices. Adobe PhotoDeluxef?? our photo-editing software that applies Adobe Photoshop technology for home use, has been one of 1997??s major successes. Version 2.0, released this year, lets users customize the product and enhance their skills by downloading free ??Guided Activities from Adobes Web site. Glyphica,a digital publishing  company, is restoring rare documents from the Olympic games using Adobe Acrobat Capture and Adobe Photoshop software. The texts and photographs many dating back to the 1890s, are then converted to Adobe PDF with Adobe Acrobat software and published on the Web site ofthe Amateur Athletic Foundation as part of an extensive virtual library. The publication of the historic documents coincides with the 1998 Olympic Winter Games in Nagano, japan. Bobbie Coughlin, a pediatrician and mother, uses Adobe PhotoDeluxe software for a variety of family projects. Whether helping her children incorporate pictures in their school reports or cleaning up cluttered backgrounds in photos, Coughlin enjoys ??altering, improving, playing with and combining photographs in new ways. Often she'll give old family photos renewed vitality by adjusting the image size adding color. ??Adobe PhotoDeluxe is wonderful! Coughlirt says. In 1997, Adobe PhotoDeluxe reached and quickly surpassed the milestone of 5 million units shipped worldwide since its introduction last year. Our strategy links Adobe PhotoDeluxe with the cameras, printers, and scanners that generate digital images by bundling it with devices from leading OEM customers such as Kodak, Epson, Hewlett-Packard, Olympus, UMAX, and many more. The success of Adobe PhotoDeluxe offers Adobe a blueprint for leveraging our technology investment by adapting high-end imaging, layout, dynamic media, pnnting, and content management software for a wider variety of customers in homes and businesses. Our strategy of adding customized user interfaces and application programming interfaces to powerful engines gives us a competitive advantage in developing products and bringing them to market quickly. We're structured for success. In late 1997, we adapted our organization to reflect our commitment to new markets To streamline planning and decision making, we now share the new Office of the Chairman of the Board. We restructured Adobes business units to focus on growing market opportunities. In addition to our Priming and Systems Division and our Graphics Products Division, we established an Enterprise Solutions Division. We also created a Home and Office Products Division to address the needs of homes and small businesses. Finally, we created an Engineering Technology Group, which will carry on Adobes tradition of developing innovative technologies and driving standards All divisions are dedicated to delivering new high-quality solutions as well as new versions of key products in 1998. Other important objectives for Adobe in 1998 include strengthening our worldwide sales organization, developing an integrated channel strategy dedicated to penetrating new markets, and coordinating marketing efforts to make Adobe one of the worlds best recognized brands. And we will continue to foster the unique corporate culture that has made us, according to FORTUNE Magazines January 12, 1998 issue, one of the ??100 Best Companies to Work for in America. "
Doc3,Adobe ,1998,"I can hear the reaction How can 16 billion of anything represent a start? After all, tallying just one billion of something is a huge accomplishment.?? OK, I admit that??s a valid point, but when your business is selling software that processes electronic transactions, you view 16 billion a little differently. Last year, TSA customers processed 16 billion transactions? the largest number yet, but just two percent of the estimated number of transactions generated around the world. That??s why at TSA, we think of 16 billion transactions as ??a start. Granted, it??s a good start. We??ve been in this business for more than 20 years and have a portfolio of applications that process smart card, debit card, credit card and loyalty card transactions from ATMs (Automated Teller Machines), POS (Pointof- Sale) devices, PCs (Personal Computers), the Internet, and a host of others. Our software is used in 70 countries by banks, retailers, stock exchanges and other enterprises needing high-volume, reliable processing seven days a week, 24 hours a day. TSA software is designed to help our more than 2,000 customers take advantage of the ongoing shift in payments from paper to pulse. This movement, fueled by the younger generation??s acceptance of electronic payments (for those of you scoring at home, my mom still won??t use an ATM, while my sons understand all too well how they work), continues to drive the growth in transaction volumes and the need for around-the-clock services?making our products even more attractive. During the past year we built on our solid history of strong financials by reaching a number of milestones. TSA achieved records in key financial metrics including record revenues of $289.8 million, record operating income of $51.0 million, and record backlog of $185.2 million. Our geographic diversity enabled TSA to ride out the recent difficult economic situations in various areas of the world. In fiscal year 1998, 54 percent of our revenues came from outside the United States. Our Americas revenues grew 20 percent, while our revenues in the Europe/Middle East/Africa region and the Asia/Pacific region were up 35 and 1 percent, respectively. In addition to our financial achievements, we completed several acquisitions to complement our product and service offerings. TSA acquired IntraNet to add to our corporate banking product expertise; SCIL and MINT to give us additional strength in the smart card product and integration arena; PRI to complement our information systems consulting offerings; and Edgeware to provide us with additional products for retailers. At TSA we believe our business of supplying software for electronic payments is just starting?that it is a business with significant growth opportunities all around the world. We also believe we are strategically positioned to take advantage of those opportunities. "
Doc4,Adobe ,1999,"For everyone at Adobe Systems, 1999 will be remembered as a year of turnaround. In late 1998, we laid the groundwork for success by streamlining operations, establishing company-wide management controls, and refining our Internet strategy. Our efforts paid off in a big way. Adobe stock began a steady ascent, and by the end of fiscal 1999, its value had increased fourfold. Additionally, our diluted earnings per share increased by 139%, from $0.77 to $1.84 year over year, our operating profit increased by 107% year over year, and Adobe became a top performer in the S&P 500. We??re not about to rest on our laurels. Adobe has begun executing a comprehensive, forward-looking business plan targeted to increase our revenue growth. We remain committed to operational excellence as well as making sure our development efforts are intensely focused on adding value to the markets we serve. We believe the Adobe vision to help people communicate better has never been clearer or more relevant than it is today. By combining fine-tuned operations with a strong product roadmap, we can take advantage of the many opportunities in front of us to become a growth company worth investing in for the long haul.  Setting new records In fiscal 1999, Adobe set many new performance and operating records. Revenue exceeded $1 billion for the first time in the company??s history, totaling $1.015 billion. This represents a 16% increase compared with fiscal 1998, after consideration of businesses divested by Adobe in 1998. Reported net income reached a record level of $238 million, a 126% increase compared with fiscal 1998. Adobe??s Web Publishing revenue grew to $394 million, an 11% increase over fiscal 1998. Print Publishing revenue grew to $354 million, a 30% year-over-year increase. Based on the explosive growth of Adobe Acrobat?? in 1999, Adobe ePaper Solutions application revenue increased 123% over fiscal 1998, growing from $58 million to $129 million in 1999. And as we projected, revenue from our OEM PostScript?? and Other segment declined from $210 million in fiscal 1998 to $138 million in fiscal 1999, a drop-off of 34%. The growth and strength in our other market segments more than offset this decline. enhancing our operating model Through a variety of restructuring measures and by improving operational efficiency, Adobe was able to enhance operations in fiscal 1999. By strategically outsourcing functions such as order fulfillment and utilizing the Internet to work more efficiently with our customers and partners worldwide, we??re working toward improving the quality and timeliness of the way we run our business. The results were measurable. General and administrative overhead was reduced by 13%, or $15 million, during the year. Direct costs were reduced, helping increase gross margins from 88.7% in fiscal 1998 to 90.7% in fiscal 1999. With expenses held in check, operating profit increased to $260 million in fiscal year 1999, up 107% compared with fiscal year 1998. This year, additional business planning programs and quantitative measures were put in place to more effectively manage our business. These processes allow our management team to closely monitor the company??s performance worldwide. Adobe??s overall financial position is strong, with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances of $499 million and no long-term debt, as of our fiscal year-end on December 3, 1999. becoming  a successful web company One of the most energizing influences at Adobe this year was the rapid and ongoing growth of the Internet as a communication and commerce medium. We responded to the unfolding Web opportunities with a multipronged online strategy. By releasing Adobe GoLive?? 4.0 in March, we rounded out a robust, industrial-strength creative environment for Web developers working on both Windows?? and Macintosh platforms. Our latest update to Adobe Photoshop,?? version 5.5, included advanced capabilities for Web graphics production and helped boost its revenue to record levels. Next year, we will continue to meet the needs of Web designers and producers with compelling new Web-focused software releases as well as Web-savvy updates of our flagship products. There??s more to Adobe??s success as a Web company than just the development of world-class applications. We??re now fully utilizing the Internet as an essential tool for conducting internal and external business processes. Within Adobe, business communications and processes are conducted over the Internet, and we ask our channel partners to conduct business with us in the same way. Perhaps the most visible expression of our intensified focus on the Internet was the relaunch of our corporate Web site, Adobe.com. The new site delivers compelling, frequently refreshed content tailored for our customer communities worldwide. And with a globally recognized brand, Adobe.com gets an average of 8.5 million visitors per month. By organizing the site into four centers directed at our primary communities, we??re providing a highly specialized destination site complete with robust technical support, Web-hosted services, and the ability to buy any Adobe product online. Strategic partnerships with other industry leaders such as Impresse, Getty Images, and Glyphica ensure that we incorporate the best products and services into the site and address our customers?? needs at Internet speed. still strong offline Our remarkable success online in 1999 does not mean we??ve in any way diminished our commitment to or leadership in our traditional markets. In August, we delivered our eagerly awaited, next-generation page layout program, Adobe InDesign,?? to a publishing industry hungry for new solutions and technologies. Adobe InDesign was a strong performer from day one. The InDesign Jump Start program helped ease the transition for large-scale publishing enterprises making a switch from other publishing technologies, and we provided equally comprehensive support to new adopters in smaller design and publishing environments. After only six months on the market, InDesign boasted several key wins. DDB Needham, McCann-Erickson, Young & Rubicam, and CAPPS Digital have adopted InDesign to streamline page layout. The robustness and extensibility of InDesign coupled with our customers?? frustration at the lack of software alternatives promise to help us secure a foothold in this $500-million-per-year market. With Adobe PressReady,?? we??re instigating another revolution in the print world. In March 1999, publishing industry guru Andrew Tribute called this desktop proofing software ??a facilitator of change . . . that can cause a fundamental switch in the market.?? And the integration of Adobe PostScript?? Extreme?? technology into high-end print systems around the globe demonstrates that we continue to drive important trends in the printing industry from the ground up. When it comes to the enterprise, Adobe??s influence has never been stronger. In April, we shipped Adobe Acrobat 4.0, a powerful, updated version of the industry-standard document exchange software. Built on feedback from our customers, the new version incorporates extensive workgroup collaboration tools and support for digital signatures. By fiscal year-end, Acrobat revenue had passed the $100 million mark, more than doubling the previous year??s revenue and firmly reiterating our leadership position. In June, we introduced Adobe ePaper Solutions. Combining a variety of Acrobat and Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) technologies, Adobe ePaper Solutions make it easier than ever for government agencies and businesses in document-intensive markets including financial services, legal, insurance, and pharmaceuticals to jointly manage their electronic and paper-based information workflows. As Adobe crosses the threshold of a new millennium, there??s much to be excited about. With the continuing evolution of the World Wide Web, we will have many opportunities to set new standards. Both large and small Web-bound companies now have access to the same kinds of eCommerce servers, routers, and other back-end technologies for true 24/7 operations. The key point of differentiation at this juncture is how companies in this fiercely competitive environment brand themselves. From maintaining a visually rich Web site to displaying goods and services with compelling fidelity, successful online retailers will capture their customers much as they have in the traditional retail world. And they??ll do it with Adobe software. From the powerful Adobe design and production applications available today to future technologies based on standards such as eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), online retailers will have access to some of the most innovative, creative tools ever created. With each of these solutions, Adobe is committed to leading the eMerchandising market just as we have led our traditional markets in the past. As we look ahead, we anticipate capturing a significant share of the professional publishing software market as Adobe InDesign becomes a solution of choice for graphic designers, agencies, and service bureaus. Speaking of solutions, we will continue to offer the well-received Adobe Collections. These powerful suites bring together three or more Adobe applications at a significant price break for professionals working on the Web, in print, in business publishing environments, or with digital video. As more enterprises learn to manage their electronic and paper information assets in a fluid, heterogeneous environment, Adobe ePaper Solutions will help them achieve their goals. The competitive prices and consumer-level availability of digital video hardware provide an opportunity for us to address the needs of all levels of users, just as we have done with our digital imaging franchise. And the electronic distribution of all manner of published content allows us to bring our expertise from the print world to the digital domain. From eBooks to digital rights management, you??ll see Adobe providing the enabling technologies that make it possible to distribute and obtain information in truly revolutionary ways. In closing, we realize that a turnaround of the magnitude Adobe has seen this year is directly attributable to the hard work, dedication, and vision of our employees. We??ve known that our people are our greatest asset since long before it became fashionable to say so, and we are committed to retaining a talented workforce and hiring the very best as we continue to grow. With their help, Adobe will continue to create, market, and support the software that helps people in all professions make inspiration become reality. "
Doc5,Adobe ,2000,"It??s hard to believe that it has been only ten years since Adobe Photoshop changed the way graphic designers work with images destined for the printed page. At that time, we couldn??t have guessed the extent of its influence. During the past decade, Adobe has distributed more than 30 million units of products based on Photoshop software, and Photoshop technology has transformed the way information is presented on the World Wide Web. Today, with a full suite of equally powerful applications, Adobe Systems has become a recognized leader in the creation, management, and delivery of rich Web content seen by millions of people worldwide. And more than 200 million copies of Acrobat Reader software have been distributed worldwide, making Adobe a global household name. As we continue to help people communicate through the creation of visually rich information, we are pursuing the many opportunities afforded by the next generation of Internet-enabled innovations, including broadband, wireless, and Internet appliance technologies. In fiscal 2000, these pursuits translated into a record year for Adobe Systems. Our diluted earnings per share increased by 23%, from $0.92 to $1.13 year over year, and our operating profit increased by 57% year over year. We achieved seven consecutive quarters of sequential revenue growth and six consecutive quarters of record revenue. Led by a highly focused management team, we executed on our existing business plan and began to set the stage for Network Publishing, a visionary Internet-centric publishing model in which all types of digital content can be published and viewed by anyone, anywhere, on any device.  As Adobe Systems continues to develop inspiring software, to catalyze innovative new markets, and to provide leadership for the Network Publishing community, we??re operating from an unprecedented position of strength. And although we will never stop refining our operational controls, our newest phase of growth relies directly upon our growing software application revenue. Simply put, we??re ready  financially, strategically, and creatively  for What??s Next. 
 RECORD NUMBERS BECOME REALITY In fiscal 2000, Adobe exceeded its internal annual revenue budget, and for the second consecutive year, revenue exceeded $1 billion, reaching a new high of $1.266 billion. This represents a 25% increase compared with fiscal 1999. Reported net income reached a record level of $288 million, a 21% increase compared with fiscal 1999. 
 Adobe??s Web Publishing revenue grew to $536.6 million, a 36% increase over fiscal 1999. Cross-media Publishing revenue grew to $390.5 million, a 10% increase. Success of Adobe Acrobat software and related products pushed Adobe ePaper Solutions application revenue from $129.3 million to $207.8 million, an increase of 61% over 1999. And as we projected, revenue from our OEM PostScript and Other segment declined in 2000 from $138.2 million to $131.5 million, which is a drop-off of 5%. The growth and strength in our other market segments more than offset this decline. 
 OUR LEANEST OPERATIONS EVER Adobe has been improving and refining company-wide operations to produce a lean, efficient organization capable of agile responses in a fast-moving marketplace. Leveraging a state-of-the-art financial system, we are now at the forefront of operational excellence in the industry. Among other achievements, we have streamlined our worldwide accounting process so we can now close two days after the quarter ends. Improvements like this have helped us build a highly predictable business operation that can readily scale as the company grows. 
 During fiscal 2000, direct costs were reduced, helping to increase gross margins from 90.7% in fiscal 1999 to 93.1% in fiscal 2000. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative overhead was reduced from 10.2% to 9.2%. With carefully managed expenses, operating profit increased to $408.1 million in fiscal 2000. 
 REVENUE GROWTH THROUGH APPLICATIONS While tight operational controls contributed significantly to our overall fiscal health, our growth was driven primarily by record revenue from our industry-standard applications. Web and print professionals enjoyed new versions of our flagship products. 
 Both Adobe Photoshop 6.0 and Adobe Illustrator 9.0 software delivered significant enhancements for working with rich Web content. With an expanded feature set and tighter integration with other Adobe applications, Adobe GoLive 5.0 software garnered rave product reviews. And Adobe LiveMotion software gave Web designers an intuitive software tool that integrates with Photoshop and GoLive and produces compelling Web animations in the Macromedia?? Flash?? (SWF) file format. As Web publishers compete for attention online, they are beginning to integrate rich media and streaming video into their Web sites. In the midst of this trend, Adobe continued to benefit as the leading provider of video-editing tools for broadcast professionals. And with dynamic media products such as Adobe Premiere and Adobe After Effects software, we are taking advantage of all aspects of the current Web media convergence. From site building tools to digital video and imaging software, Adobe empowers Web designers to showcase their products online, build strong Web brands, and make e-commerce a reality. 
 For cross-media professionals, we continued to deliver layout tools that streamline the management of digital assets between the print and Web worlds. The latest update to Adobe InDesign software addressed many of our customers?? workflow concerns, and we increased our investment in markets where we are working to establish InDesign as the professional layout application of choice. While this market will not grow as rapidly as Web Publishing, it nonetheless represents a $500 million per year opportunity that we continue to pursue. Adobe PageMaker software enjoyed strong success with business professionals, and Adobe FrameMaker?? software continued to be the preferred application for the publication of complex technical documents. Adobe??s solutions for page layout, illustration, business publishing, and printing enable graphic designers, production artists, and prepress professionals to create the visually rich information we see every day on the printed page. 
 BEYOND THE ENTERPRISE Built on the foundation of Adobe Portable Document Format, Adobe ePaper Solutions continued to bridge the worlds of digital and paper-based information in corporations, government agencies, and other large organizations. And while revenue from Adobe Acrobat set all-time records in 2000, Adobe ePaper Solutions are now reaching far beyond the enterprise. In 2000, Adobe PDF became an important format in the emerging eBook market. In March, Stephen King??s Riding the Bullet became the first book from a major author to be published only in Adobe PDF. And in September, Adobe acquired Glassbook, Inc., further solidifying our position as a leader in this young but extremely promising space. As the eBook market continues to evolve, we plan to offer solutions that allow the easy reading and printing of Adobe PDF  based eBook content from any device. And as the Internet becomes the preferred medium for exchanging information, Adobe ePaper Solutions will continue to provide innovative tools for preserving documents exactly as intended and exchanging them securely with anyone, anywhere. 
 As we pioneer new markets and help define the future of publishing, we must also remember our roots. PostScript, the page description language that launched Adobe and helped start the Desktop Publishing revolution, is still the technology graphics pros and publishers rely on for quality printing. That??s one of the main reasons the OEM PostScript and Other segment of our business composed 10% of our overall revenue in fiscal 2000. 
 NETWORK PUBLISHING As the Third Wave of the modern publishing revolution, Network Publishing will enable the streamlined creation, management, and delivery of visual content that can be deployed across any device including Web-enabled wireless phones, Internet appliances, and PDAs. Adobe is leveraging our legacy of leadership, especially our workflow expertise, to make this vision a reality. But we??re not doing it alone. In October 2000, several industry leaders  including Interwoven, Hewlett- Packard, Nokia, RealNetworks, and ATG  announced support for the joint development of complementary technologies that will empower both corporations and individuals to communicate like never before. 
 Network Publishing promises to be just as important to the coming decade as Desktop Publishing and Web Publishing were to the ??80s and ??90s. The opportunity to change the way technology is developed and deployed, along with holistic employee benefits and a uniquely creative work environment, are just a few of the reasons that hundreds of engineers as well as sales, marketing, finance, and support professionals choose to work at Adobe. In fact, this year Adobe Systems can be found once again in FORTUNE Magazine??s ??100 Best Companies to Work for.?? We are also among the technology leaders committed to making a difference. Through cash grants, employee volunteer support, and nonprofit training, the Adobe Community Relations program makes significant contributions in the areas of K 12 education, fair housing, and other social services. More information on these programs is available at www.adobe.com /aboutadobe/philanthropy. 
 At Adobe, we consider ourselves to have four primary constituents: our customers, our stockholders, our employees, and our community. By continuing to provide inspiring products, increasing stockholder value, creating an innovative workplace, and investing in community relations, we strive to address each constituent??s needs. We thank you for your part in making Adobe successful. 
"
Doc6,Adobe ,2001,"During fiscal 2001, Adobe Systems assumed a leadership role in turning the promise of Network Publishing into reality. Working closely with our partners, we delivered powerful software tools that help our customers publish anything, anywhere, on any device. We listened closely to our customers to discover how Network Publishing is unfolding in today??s changing communications environment. We introduced technologies that enable the delivery of highly personalized, visually rich content?and the industry took notice. Communications from both our partners and competitors echoed our vision and are helping to establish Network Publishing as the model for the next wave of publishing. Just as important, Adobe ePaper Solutions made further strides into the enterprise, and Adobe PDF has provided a foundation for streamlined corporate and government electronic document workflows worldwide.  Even with these successes, Adobe Systems, like many technology leaders, experienced a difficult fiscal 2001. Our diluted earnings per share decreased from $1.13 to $0.83 year over year, and our operating profit decreased by 7% year over year. One of the greatest factors contributing to these results was the widespread decision by enterprises to defer capital investments, including software purchases. And creative professionals?our core customers?were hit particularly hard as corporations spent less on marketing and advertising programs. As Adobe tracks these and other trends, we are working toward meeting our customers?? changing needs. 
 As enterprises and governments worldwide streamlined their processes to more fully leverage their Internet-based infrastructures, we delivered Adobe ePaper Solutions, such as Adobe Acrobat, to drive this evolution from paper-based to digital workflows. In April, we shipped Adobe Acrobat 5.0, which has garnered excellent reviews and impressive revenue. In fact, despite the difficult economic environment, revenue from Acrobat software grew more than 40% over fiscal 2000 and now represents 24% of Adobe??s total revenue. For large organizations implementing Web-based electronic forms solutions, we introduced Adobe Acrobat Approval software. And newly released versions of Acrobat Reader for Palm OS and Pocket PC devices allowed publishers to deliver Adobe PDF files to millions of handheld device users. 
 Looking at the coming year, we are inspired by the opportunities that lie ahead. As publishers, advertising agencies, and creative professionals adopt Network Publishing workflows, Adobe will provide the tools they need to create, manage, and deliver visually rich communications. Surging sales of digital cameras and digital video recorders are opening a huge opportunity for Adobe??s marketleading imaging software. And the continued streamlining of corporate business processes means an even greater opportunity for Adobe ePaper Solutions, our fastest growing market segment. Leveraging these trends, our strong cash position, and continued operational excellence, we will ensure that Adobe continues to be everywhere our stockholders, partners, and customers look. 
 In fiscal 2001, Adobe achieved revenue of $1.230 billion. This represents a 3% decrease compared with fiscal 2000. Reported net income reached a level of $205.6 million, a 29% decrease compared with fiscal 2000. Operating profit was $378.5 million in fiscal 2001, a decrease of 7% compared to fiscal 2000. Based on our new operating segments, Adobe??s Graphics revenue was $543.4 million, a 10% decrease from fiscal 2000. Cross-media Publishing revenue was $289.6 million, an 11% decrease. Revenue from our OEM PostScript and Other segment declined in 2001, from $131.5 million to $104.8 million, a drop-off of 20%. And robust licensing of Adobe Acrobat software and related products pushed Adobe ePaper Solutions revenue from $207.6 million to $291.9 million, an increase of 41% over 2000. (For further information on our former and new business segments, please refer to our Form 10-K.) 
 Despite the difficult economic environment of fiscal 2001, we showed that we can tightly manage our business. We minimized direct costs, resulting in gross margins of 93.4%, compared with 93.1% in fiscal 2000. Additionally, soon after the economy began to affect our business during the year, we swiftly exercised company-wide operational expense reductions, which enabled us to deliver respectable bottom-line results. 
 Adobe continues to be a highly profitable company, and we are operating from a strong financial position. On a GAAP basis, our operating profit margin was 31% in fiscal 2001. On a pro forma basis, our operating profit margin (which excludes restructuring and other charges, acquired in-process research and development, and amortization of goodwill) was 33%. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $581.6 million as of November 30, 2001. And although we reduced our overall expenses during the year, we continued to increase research and development headcount. In fiscal 2001, Adobe spent nearly a quarter of a billion dollars on R&D. This investment will help position us for long-term growth and success. 
 While some of Adobe??s competitors focused their efforts on developing either Web- or print-only publishing tools, we believed our customers would want to communicate both onscreen and on the printed page, and we developed our software solutions accordingly. In fiscal 2002, Adobe will continue to deliver cross-media applications that allow publishers to communicate cost-effectively in the medium of their choice. 
 With the announcement of InDesign 2.0 software, we continued to rally support among professional publishers and designers looking for an alternative publishing application. Adobe PageMaker software continues to provide business users with the tools they need to communicate with impact, and Adobe FrameMaker software remains the application of choice for producers of long, structured documents. Adobe Premiere and Adobe After Effects are becoming increasingly popular, due to exceptional growth in the digital video (DV) market, where Adobe has a strong position in the professional segment. Customers making the switch from analog to digital photography are licensing our new consumer-oriented imaging software, Adobe Photoshop Elements. And for creative professionals working in print and on the Web, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator software continue to set the standard for high-end digital imaging and illustration, and they lead the market in their respective categories. 
 After announcing our vision for Network Publishing last year, we worked hard to deliver tools that would allow anyone to create, manage, and deliver visually rich communications anytime, anywhere, on any device. The latest version of InDesign software allows the import and export of XML for unique layouts in print and on the Web. Adobe Illustrator 10 enables a dynamic data-driven graphics workflow, automating the most time-consuming production tasks. And Adobe AlterCast software, a new server-based application, allows the customization and delivery of optimized graphics to multiple access devices, including desktop computers, PDAs, and wireless phones. We also unveiled the eXtensible Metadata Platform (XMP), a new open standard for cross-media development that enables the easy and accurate exchange of publishing assets between software applications. Delivering high levels of interoperability, this new protocol opens up exciting opportunities for both Adobe and its strategic partners. 
 Even though the development of world-class software tools remains a top priority, we begin fiscal 2002 with a renewed commitment to our customers. More than ever, we??re listening carefully to what our customers have to say, implementing product functionality and support levels based on their feedback. Internally, we??ve thoroughly reorganized our Customer Care organization, realigning its goals with those of our field sales teams so that we can more effectively meet our customers?? changing needs. Adobe continues to be equally committed to the needs of our community. Everywhere you look, Adobe employees are donating time, money, and expertise to a number of critical nonprofit causes?including initiatives in the fields of K?12 education, fair housing, and other social services?under the auspices of the Adobe Community Relations program. Adobe also contributed $500,000 in combined employee and corporate donations to the American Red Cross September 11 fund. 
 Adobe continues to attract the very best talent. Although we slowed our hiring in fiscal 2001, we continued to invest in the future by filling critical positions throughout the year. As eager as we are for their expertise, these employees are equally eager to work for a company that FORTUNE magazine has included in its ??100 Best Companies to Work For?? list four of the last five years. 
 We??ve all been on an economic roller coaster this past fiscal year. As we look to the near future, we are confident that we can manage Adobe Systems through difficult times. And our focus?as always?is on the long term. Once the current economic malaise subsides, we believe we will be well positioned to drive revenue growth and expand our profitability. We??ve aligned our product road map to match the growing trends we see not only in Network Publishing but also in digital imaging and digital video software. We??re excited about emerging opportunities in areas such as digital photo management, DVD authoring, and Internet printing?new markets we are actively exploring. And we??re charging more than half of our field sales organization with realizing our single largest growth opportunity, Adobe ePaper Solutions. With Acrobat and related products, we??re helping enterprises migrate from paper-based workflows to Web-centric electronic document workflows. 
 Our market-leading franchise products and their loyal customers, our world-class global operation, and our highly profitable business continue to fuel our excitement about Adobe??s future. We look forward to sharing our ongoing success with you. 
"
Doc7,Adobe ,2002,"As Adobe Systems?? twentieth year of helping people communicate better comes to a close, we??re pleased to see our customers using Adobe solutions?as well as complementary technologies from our partners?to create, manage, and deliver visually rich information to anyone, anywhere, on any device. For the fourth consecutive year, strong sales of Adobe Acrobat software licenses have contributed to making the enterprise our single greatest market opportunity. We??ve made significant inroads with Adobe InDesign?? page layout software. And Adobe Photoshop Elements software has been embraced by over a million customers as the professional-quality, mid-level digital imaging software of choice.  Still, this past year many of our core customers grappled with unfavorable business conditions and market uncertainty. Design agencies, publishing houses, and other creative organizations faced smaller client budgets and reduced staffing, leading them to decrease their spending on capital expenditures such as new software. As a result of this reduced demand, as well as an overall weakened global economy, our diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2002 decreased by 5% year over year from $0.83 to $0.79, and our operating profit decreased by 24% year over year. In this difficult economic climate, we concentrated on reinforcing our strong market positions and preparing ourselves for the future with increased research and development. 
 The results of our efforts will allow us to take advantage of several culminating market trends. Cost-conscious enterprises are looking to find greater return on their existing technology investments, creative professionals are looking for ways to save money and improve efficiency, and home and office users need easy-to-use software to help them work with a new generation of digital cameras and video cameras. Adobe plans to roll out solutions that address each of these trends, and we??ve realigned our organization to more effectively deliver these solutions to an eager customer base. 
 In addition to a strong product roadmap, we remain profitable, with a strong cash position achieved through highly disciplined operational controls. Our transparent reporting system gives us a 24/7 view into worldwide operations, leading to greater efficiencies and reduced costs. Unusual among software companies, this financial strength gives Adobe a competitive advantage and long-term confidence. With a combination of powerful customer-facing solutions and solid bottom-line financials, we will strive to provide strong market leadership and stockholder value as we enter decade number three. 
 For fiscal year 2002, we are reporting earnings of $191.4 million. This represents a 7% decrease compared with fiscal year 2001. We made changes to our reporting structure, moving some of our products into new categories that more accurately reflect their usage by our customers. Adobe??s Creative Professional revenue was $351.3 million, an 11% decrease over fiscal year 2001. Digital Imaging and Video revenue was $411.9 million, a 6% decrease. Sales of Adobe Acrobat software and related products pushed Adobe ePaper?? solutions application revenue from $291.9 million to $312.5 million, an increase of 7% over fiscal year 2001. Revenue from our OEM PostScript and Other segment declined from $104.8 million to $89.0 million, a decrease of 15%. 
 During fiscal year 2002, gross margins were 91.0%, compared to 93.4% in fiscal 2001. As a percentage of revenue, research and development expenses were 21.1%, compared to 18.2% in 2001 ? a reflection of Adobe??s commitment to continue to invest in its future. Sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses, as a percent of revenue, were 32.7% and 9.3% respectively ? essentially at the same levels in 2002 when compared to 2001. Thanks to our ongoing financial discipline, we once again end the year in a solid financial position, with $617.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. 
 Fiscal year 2002 was marked by several highlights. Accelerating our reach into the enterprise was our April acquisition of Accelio. The company??s electronic forms offerings provide the foundation of our newest ePaper solutions, and we anticipate that the acquired expertise in selling into the enterprise should be a major asset moving forward. We introduced several server-based applications, including Adobe?? Document Server, which automates document production and delivers targeted, secure, and reliable electronic documents to virtually any platform a business or government agency may require. 
 Within the design community, Adobe InDesign 2.0 software gained more customers among publishers and creative agencies worldwide. This version of our next-generation page layout software incorporates several innovative new features to deliver a top-notch application. Since its release in January, InDesign 2.0 has gained significant market share. In April, we released a new version of Adobe Photoshop software to widespread acclaim. And professional videographers working with corporate and broadcast video continued to make Adobe Premiere?? and Adobe After Effects?? software leaders in their category on the Windows?? platform. 
 Software collections, bringing together several flagship Adobe applications for specific customer requirements, continued to do well. Offering a complete solution, these suites allow customers to adopt multiple Adobe applications simultaneously at a great value. Licensing of Adobe Collections by our customers continues to represent a significant portion of Adobe??s revenue. 
 In fiscal year 2002, our partnerships became more strategically important. Of particular note is our agreement with enterprise software provider SAP. By integrating Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) technology with SAP solutions, this partnership is an important step toward establishing Adobe as an essential enterprise infrastructure provider. Other important relationships include those with Dell and Documentum. 
 At a time when investor confidence is being tested, Adobe is committed to closely following all newly established rules, certifications, and board independence requirements, and we will continue to conduct our operations with integrity. 
 Adobe??s focus for the coming fiscal year is threefold: to extend our business to the enterprise by developing and delivering enterprise-class ePaper solutions, to provide more value to our creative professional customers, and to extend our digital imaging and video businesses to meet the needs of home and business users. Underlying each of these goals is the evolution of Adobe PDF as a robust, rich media container that complements other established standards such as the eXtensible Markup Language (XML). The use of Adobe PDF as a format for reliable, multiplatform communications spans all of Adobe??s customers, including creative professionals, businesses, and government agencies. No other technology today can equal what Adobe PDF provides, and we intend to continue to innovate its functionality?including extending it as a container for delivering digital photographs. 
 For the enterprise, we are extending our Adobe Acrobat software-based ePaper solutions to help corporations, government agencies, and other large organizations move from paper-based workflows to electronic document-based workflows. Leveraging our reach through the now ubiquitous Acrobat Reader??, we are delivering end-to-end, client- and server-based solutions that help enterprises both save and make money. To support these goals, we are refocusing our direct sales force to sell directly to executives, line of business managers, and IT managers. 
 We??re also giving increased attention to creative professionals, developing powerful tools that allow them to do their jobs more efficiently, creatively, and at a lower cost. Whether working in the creative departments of large enterprises or as independent professionals, these demanding power users depend on Adobe products to help them create the visually rich content found in newspapers, magazines, on television, on the Web, and in marketing communications of all kinds. Besides continuing to improve the industry-standard applications that are found in nearly every creative professional??s toolbox, we plan to offer newly designed software collections with greater integration and interoperability for enhanced creative workflows. 
 Lastly, Adobe stands to benefit from the explosive trend of home and business users migrating from analog to digital photography and video. For these customers ? including photography enthusiasts, home users, educators, and office workers in charge of producing corporate videos and internal Web sites? we??re rolling out applications designed to help them master the world of digital expression. In addition to a new version of our well-received Adobe Photoshop Elements software, we recently released Adobe Photoshop Album software. This new Adobe software will help people organize and share their digital photos. We??re also developing a new professional tool for video authoring that creative professionals can use to deliver rich media on a new, portable broadband platform: DVD. 
 We consider this year to mark not only a twentieth anniversary, but also a birth ; with solid solutions developed and key partnerships established, we are emerging as a key competitive player in the enterprise. The following pages of this Annual Report will show you how we are working to deliver robust solutions that help enterprises communicate better with their employees, their customers, and their business partners. 
 As we take our mission to help people communicate better into the enterprise, we are determined to uphold the values that make Adobe Systems a great company in every sense of the word. We plan to continue to invest heavily in research and development, creating innovative products and services that meet our customers?? diverse needs. We remain committed to seeking out, hiring, and retaining the most creative employees in the industry. And we are proud of our community involvement: our community relations department sponsors a variety of programs to benefit our local communities, including software donations, cash grants, and volunteer efforts. 
"
Doc8,Adobe ,2003,"When we think of the word ??platform,?? several concepts come to mind: a strong foundation, a launching pad, an elevated vantage point. Those of you who have followed technology for the last couple of decades have seen several examples of companies that provide foundational platforms on which customers and partners can build their businesses and add value. This year we took a look at the way our own customers have standardized on Adobe software and solutions and came to an inescapable conclusion: Adobe has transformed itself into a platform company. "
Doc9,Adobe ,2003," Not that long ago, Adobe was a company thought of almost exclusively in terms of its products. Today, we provide a foundation of innovative technologies on which our customers can be more creative, save time and money, and run their businesses more efficiently. We??ve built these foundations in three areas: Intelligent Documents, design, and digital imaging. Within each of these domains you??ll find Adobe software tools?as well as complementary technologies from partners?that help our customers share ideas, information, and memories. Together, these platforms represent the foundation of our success in the present and the launching pad of our vision for the future. For our customers, our partners, and you, our stockholders, they also represent a firm place to stand.  Not that long ago, Adobe was a company thought of almost exclusively in terms of its products.

Together, these platforms represent the foundation of our success in the present and the launching pad of our vision for the future. For our customers, our partners, and you, our stockholders, they also represent a firm place to stand. 
 Fiscal year 2003 was an excellent year for Adobe Systems. With one of the strongest new product lineups in the company??s history, and more stable global economic conditions, we met or exceeded Wall Street expectations in every quarter in fiscal 2003. In addition, we grew our annual revenue to a record $1.295 billion, representing an 11 percent year-over-year growth when compared with fiscal 2002. Our diluted earnings per share increased from $0.79 to $1.10, and our operating profit margin expanded to more than 29 percent for fiscal 2003. Reported net income from all market segments reached $266.3 million, a 39 percent increase when compared with fiscal 2002. Adobe??s Creative Professional revenue was $368.5 million, a 5 percent increase over fiscal 2002. Digital Imaging and Video revenue was $392.4 million, a 5 percent decrease year over year. Licensing of Adobe Acrobat?? software and related products pushed Adobe ePaper?? Solutions application revenue from $312.6 million in fiscal 2002 to $444.1 million in fiscal 2003, a 42 percent increase year over year. Finally, revenue from our OEM PostScript?? and Other segment was $89.7 million, a 1 percent increase when compared with fiscal 2002. 
 Due to strong operational cash flows and cash proceeds from stock options, our cash position grew significantly in 2003. Our strong cash position of nearly $1.1 billion provides the flexibility to both invest in our future and continue to return cash to our stockholders through repurchase and our quarterly stock dividend. And by investing approximately 20 percent of our revenue in research and development, we are able to stay at the forefront of the markets we serve. From sales and engineering to marketing and finance, we??ve achieved a level of operational excellence uncommon in the software industry. And, as befits a major software company, we??ve kept our business processes streamlined and accountable. Further, we have deployed centralized information systems that provide real-time financial information to quickly assess our business performance throughout the world. 
 Ethics and integrity have always been an important part of both Adobe??s culture and our way of doing business, and we take corporate governance very seriously, seeking to achieve the same level of excellence as we do in all other aspects of our business. 
 We successfully executed the strategy that we outlined for you last year. As promised, in our fastest growing business, ePaper Solutions, we helped enterprises and government agencies migrate their legacy paper-based workflows to electronic document workflows. With the release of Adobe Acrobat 6.0, we not only delivered a strong product, but also segmented the product line to meet a broader set of customer needs: Acrobat Professional for demanding collaborative environments such as the creative professional segment and engineering, Acrobat Standard for working with Adobe PDF across the enterprise, and Acrobat Elements for basic Adobe PDF creation on the desktop. With this strategy we achieved record revenue for this powerful application? in the third quarter alone, Acrobat desktop revenue exceeded $100 million. 
 We also further extended our Intelligent Document Platform to deliver document services that help connect people to back-end enterprise systems. Allowing large organizations to customize their outbound communications, Adobe Document Server software filled out our offerings for document generation. By making Adobe PDF forms interactive, Adobe Document Server for Reader Extensions delivered document collaboration and electronic forms capabilities to corporations and government agencies around the world. In all of our enterprise initiatives, we differentiated ourselves from the competition by concentrating on the ways that people work with information and business processes, rather than only on the ways that machines talk to other machines. 
 For our creative professional customers, we fulfilled our promise to add value by delivering the Adobe Creative Suite. With this revolutionary platform, we combined new versions of all of our flagship software products?including Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, and Adobe GoLive???with Version Cue,?? an innovative file management feature, to form a complete solution that allows creative professionals to work in newly efficient, collaborative workflows. Moving forward, we expect that all of the standalone products that are part of the Adobe Creative Suite, as well as the Suite itself, will be updated simultaneously, resulting in higher customer satisfaction and a streamlined product development cycle. Also of note in the creative professional space is the increased adoption of InDesign software as the page layout application of choice for major newspapers, publishers, and advertising agencies. By delivering enhanced creative freedom, an integrated workflow, support for rich media including video, and an ecosystem of service providers and partners, we??re seeing increased adoption of InDesign in this competitive space. 
 Users of our digital imaging and video software took advantage of several new and important product releases. Digital imaging hobbyists wanting to use the professional power of Adobe Photoshop found tools to retouch, organize, and share their photos in Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Photoshop Album software. With these products, we shared our leading digital imaging platform with a broader range of customers than ever before. Similarly, video professionals gained a complete solution with the release of the Adobe Video Collection, which brings together several leading Adobe digital video products. At the core of the collection is an entirely rewritten version of Adobe Premiere,?? now called Adobe Premiere Pro. With newly improved performance and enhanced capabilities, this video editing tool is poised to lead the market. The collection also includes a major upgrade of Adobe After Effects, as well as two new professional-grade applications: Adobe Encore?? DVD for DVD production and Adobe Audition?? for sound editing. 
 Just as Adobe has transformed itself into a company that delivers platforms rather than tools or products, our customers?? businesses and markets are transforming in significant ways. By maintaining our strong relationships with our customers, we will anticipate and meet their evolving needs. In the enterprise space, we see the XMLbased interchange of information moving from the pilot phase to everyday reality. To that end, all of our enterprise solutions will incorporate robust XML support in the form of ??Intelligent Documents.?? By combining Adobe PDF with XML, these documents connect people, systems, and processes in innovative ways. In fact, what used to be called the Adobe ePaper Business Unit is now known as the Intelligent Documents Business Unit. With more than half a billion copies of Adobe Reader distributed on all major operating systems and devices, along with the fact that Adobe PDF has become the de facto standard format for the delivery of electronic documents, our customers have an unmatched platform from which they can reliably interact with information. 
 As broadband and various new access devices continue to proliferate, creative professionals will be called on to repurpose rich media content at an accelerated rate. In the largest production environments, they will also have to manage tens of thousands of digital assets while attempting to streamline workflows. With the Adobe Creative Suite design platform, we help our customers accomplish these demanding imperatives. For example, our new Version Cue technology helps ensure that workgroups of all sizes can work on highly complex, asset-intensive projects collaboratively. And when it comes to Adobe InDesign, we continue to see increased adoption, solidifying our position as the page layout and design solution of choice for users who are eager to make the switch from non-Adobe applications. 
 In 2003, sales of digital cameras surpassed sales of traditional film cameras, and by the year 2005, it??s expected that 100 percent of video cameras sold will be digital. Our strategy for taking advantage of this opportunity with our digital imaging platform is threefold. First, we will strengthen the leadership of the gold standard for desktop digital imaging, Adobe Photoshop. As we evolve the application??s features to match the next generation of digital photography, we plan to increase market share among influential new customers, including professional photographers. Second, we will continue to extend Photoshop technology to a rapidly growing number of hobbyists and consumers. As these users grow to desire more sophisticated capabilities, they will find a smooth upgrade path from Photoshop Album and Photoshop Elements to the full version of Photoshop. Finally, we expect to provide more market-leading digital video tools?not only for creative professional customers looking to expand their skill sets, but also for video producers within corporations and large organizations who are moving from analog to digital production. 
 Although Adobe has transformed itself into a platform company, our essential strategy has not dramatically changed. We plan to move forward in our key growth markets, using the power of our technology platforms to meet the needs of customers, effectively leverage an ecosystem of partners, and provide more value to stockholders. As always, we??ll continue to focus on our customers?? perspective, incorporating their input into the way we plan for and develop solutions. And, just as we have for more than twenty years, we??ll count on Adobe innovation as the stimulus for new revenue streams. 
 For Adobe, being a model employer and responsible corporate citizen has always been an important part of creating stockholder value. We??ve been recognized for many years as one of the ??100 Best Companies to Work For?? by FORTUNE magazine, and we??re especially proud to be listed in the number six position in the 2004 report. By inspiring our employees to contribute at peak performance and share in the success of the company, we??re ensuring a steady rate of innovation and growth. We??re also contributing to our communities and helping to improve the quality of life by addressing critical needs, primarily through schools and nonprofit organizations that reach underserved populations in areas where Adobe employees live and work. 
 Being a platform company means more than just setting industry standards. It means helping people and businesses communicate better by helping them integrate information, images, and insights. They can do it with the power of Adobe??s innovative technologies, tools, products, and services, and they will do it in new and paradigm-shifting ways over the coming years.

Doc10,Aspen ,1996,"Fiscal 1996 was a year of dramatic accomplishment for AspenTech. In January 1996, we announced the acquisition of two leading suppliers of on-line advanced automation solutions, DMC Corporation (DMCC) and Setpoint, Inc., on the same day. This sent an electrifying message to our industry. Overnight we became the largest company by far dedicated to providing process modeling and advanced automation solutions to the process industries, with the leading market share in every major business area in which we compete. We instantly became a leading supplier to the petroleum industry, complementing our historic strength in the chemicals and other process industries. And we significantly increased our competitive differentiation by becoming the only company that can provide off-line and on-line solutions across the full life-cycle of a process, from research and development to engineering to production.  Fiscal 1996 was also a year of significant financial achievement. Revenues increased 80% to $103.6 million, compared with $57.5 million in fiscal 1995. Net income excluding non-recurring costs for fiscal 1996 was $9.2 million, compared with $6.0 million last year, a 53% increase. Earnings per share excluding non-recurring costs for fiscal 1996 were $1.10, compared with $0.77 for fiscal 1995 
 We have naturally focused significant management attention on the integration of DMCC and Setpoint into AspenTech. This has been a particularly challenging task because there were overlapping products and services among these companies, the original AspenTech and Industrial Systems, Inc. (which we acquired in May 1995), in the areas of process information management, advanced control and real-time optimization technology. 
 I am very pleased to report that the integration process has gone extremely well. We have successfully reorganized operations into new AspenTech divisions, headed by strong management teams, that have established clear strategic and product release plans for the business areas. We have made outstanding progress in producing new software releases that combine the best features from overlapping products while providing existing customers with a forward migration path; ??beta?? test versions of new advanced control and process information management software tools are being released in the fall of 1996. We have created a single, account-focused sales team that is now successfully selling all of the company??s products and services. Most important, the new AspenTech community is working well together, focused far more on the opportunities that lay ahead than on past company affiliations. 
 The customer response to the acquisitions has been overwhelmingly positive. By being able to provide a more complete solution that touches the full life-cycle of their manufacturing operations, We have become a more strategic supplier to many of our customers. A life-cycle approach offers a number of benefits to customers: it reduces the time and cost required to generate new applications; it facilitates sharing of information between different departments within the company; it reduces the training and support costs of maintaining incompatible software tools; and it helps to create a consistent overall system within the company for managing the analysis and implementation of process technology. Our sales staff and senior management are now routinely working more closely with the top management of process manufacturers to define profit improvement programs that include the systematic use of AspenTech products and services. 
 We have added considerable depth to our management team in fiscal 1996 to better enable us to manage the growth that lies ahead. Several senior managers from DMCC and Setpoint have joined our management team and bring extensive industry experience, particularly in managing project execution operations. We have added several new executives from outside AspenTech to the management team, including a new Chief Information Officer, General Counsel and vice presidents in software engineering, marketing and human resources. We have also made major investments in the infrastructure necessary to support our expansion, particularly in the area of management information systems. 
 AspenTech also made two key additions to its Board of Directors during the year. Gresham T. Brebach,Jr. is currently Executive Vice President Client Services of Renaissance Solutions, Inc., a leading provider of management consulting and client/server systems integration services for large corporations. Brebach has also served as Executive Vice President of Digital Consulting, the management consulting division of Digital Equipment Corporation, and as head of the North American Information Technology/Services consulting practice of McKinsey Company; he brings tremendous expertise in managing value-added service businesses to the Board. Alison Ross heads Smart Finance  Company, an investment banking advisory service for technology companies. Prior to founding Smart Finance, Ross led the software investment banking effort of Montgomery Securities. Ross?? independent perspective and expertise in financing strategies have already been of great value to the company. 
 AspenTech has never been stronger than it is today. The acquisitions in the on-line areas have greatly expanded the size of our available market and have significantly increased our opportunity to cross-sell products and services to our customer base. We remain the technology leader in off-line modeling, and the on-line businesses that we acquired also lead their fields technically. In addition, we are continuing to attract the top people in our industry to work at AspenTech. I am extremely enthusiastic about our prospects for the Future. 
 Our primary focus for 1997 will be on delivering releases of new, integrated products and on expanding our project execution capability, particularly in advanced control and optimization. We expect to continue to be opportunistic regarding potential acquisitions that fit with our focus of delivering solutions based upon fundamental process knowledge to industry. And we will continue both to increase our penetration within existing customers and to expand our strength in vertical markets beyond chemicals and petroleum. 
 I would like to thank our employees for their dedication to meeting our business objectives while successfully bringing AspenTech and our acquisitions together this past year, and our shareholders for their continued confidence. 
"
Doc11,Aspen ,1997,"Fiscal 1997 was a year of tremendous achievement for AspenTech. By focusing on our True Potential, we began to realize the vision of enabling our customers to achieve theirs. We are now truly the only company that offers a complete solution for customers encompassing both off-line modeling and simulation and on-line automation, consisting of both software and the services to implement them. During fiscal 1997 we completed the integration of Setpoint and DMCC. On the technology front, we acquired three companies to add strategic new technologies; we created a new team to deliver services for advanced process design; we released several major new products; we established strategic relationships with a number of major customers; and we intensified our focus on the large and rapidly growing Smart Manufacturing marketplace.  Fiscal 1997 was also a year of record financial results. Revenues increased 74% to $180.3 million compared with $103.6 million for fiscal 1996. Net income excluding nonrecurring costs rose 118% to $20.1 million for fiscal 1997 compared with $9.2 million the year before. Earnings per share excluding nonrecurring costs for fiscal 1997 were $0.96 compared with $0.55 for fiscal 1996, adjusted to reflect a two-for-one stock split effective February 28, 1997. A portion of this growth was attributed to the acquisitions of DMCC and Setpoint. Our successful integration of these companies makes us enthusiastic about the opportunities for robust revenue growth and further margin expansion in the future. 
 We acquired three businesses during fiscal 1997, each of which provided strategic capabilities. In October 1996 we announced the acquisition of the process control division of Cambridge Control Limited, located in Cambridge, England, adding capacity to execute advanced process control projects in Europe. We also announced the acquisition of B-JAC International, a leading supplier of detailed heat exchanger modeling software, based in Richmond, Virginia, which allowed us to tightly link the B-JAC?? tools with ASPEN PLUS?? to provide customers with a common model from design through the specifications with their equipment manufacturers. In January 1997 we acquired Bechtel??s PIMS (Process Industries Modeling System) business, adding to our family market-leading software products for economic planning and scheduling based on linear programming technology. This acquisition was very strategic for us because now we are able to integrate the PIMS software with our solutions for on-line optimization to deliver production planning integrated with on-line closed-loop optimization. 
 We were active in delivering new releases of several important products. By January 1997 we had shipped unified products from the merged companies: InfoPlus.21?? for process information management, DMCplus?? for advanced control, and RT-OPT?? for real-time optimization. In March 1997 we shipped the first commercial release of BATCH PLUS?? for modeling of complex, recipe-based pharmaceutical and batch chemical processes. AspenTech worked closely with key customers, including Merck, to develop this product, which was one of the most successful new products in AspenTech??s history. It generated more than $1 million of revenue in the first quarter after its release. In May 1997 we shipped DynaPLUS,?? a system that lets users create a rigorous dynamic model of a process from an ASPEN PLUS model in a fraction of the time that was previously required. In May 1997 we also shipped the Windows?? release of ADVENT?? for process integration and synthesis, to bring all of the power of ADVENT to the Windows 95 and NT environments. 
 In addition to world-class products, we also focus on providing highest-quality customer support. In November 1996 AspenTech was awarded the prestigious STAR Award, presented annually by the Software Support Professionals Association (SSPA) for delivering exceptional software support to its worldwide customer base. AspenTech is the only software and services vendor supporting the process manufacturing industry to have received this recognition since the award??s inception in 1990. 
 During fiscal 1997 we intensified our focus on the large and rapidly growing marketplace for the Smart Manufacturing System. These systems provide integrated technology for design, operation, and management of process manufacturing systems based upon a common, consistent set of core models of a process. The models are based upon fundamental engineering knowledge. They provide a framework that can be used over the life cycle of a process, from development to design to production. During manufacturing operations, the Smart Manufacturing System provides a complete integrated system for manufacturing execution between the enterprise resource planning system and the distributed control system in the field. 
 To accelerate our Smart Manufacturing System offering, in April we announced the formation of a strategic alliance with Lyondell Petrochemical Company to work jointly to develop and implement a prototype of the Smart Manufacturing System at Lyondell??s Matagorda County, Texas facility. In May we announced the formation of a strategic alliance with SAP America to provide integrated business and manufacturing solutions to the process industries. Both AspenTech and SAP will be working closely together to enable Lyondell to achieve a dramatic improvement in their manufacturing work processes as a result of the prototype system. 
 We also announced major alliances and special customer relationships with DSM, Pequiven, BP Oil International, The Dow Chemical Company, and Phelps Dodge to work closely together to execute a program to implement solutions based on our off-line modeling and simulation and on-line automation technologies. These customers have recognized that by committing to a program co-managed by AspenTech and themselves, they can implement the technologies faster and achieve quicker economic returns than by contracting for individual projects one at a time. 
 During fiscal 1997 we added management talent. Steve Doyle joined the company as General Counsel and Ernie Valentine as Vice President for Human Resources. In June 1997 we appointed David McQuillin Executive Vice President for Worldwide Sales and Marketing. These individuals bring strong experience to our organization and position us for the next phase of growth. 
 Bill Rousseau, who served as a Director of AspenTech since it was founded in 1981, retired from the position in December 1996. Bill and his wife Margaret were the first outside investors in AspenTech, and their support and guidance played a key role in our success. I would like to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude for the many contributions that Bill has made over the years. 
 Our primary focus for fiscal 1998 will be on delivering the Windows NT releases of ASPEN PLUS and SPEEDUP as well as Release 3.2 of RT-OPT, and upon growing our services capability to execute the automation projects for which we are seeing strong demand. Much of our growth will continue to come from existing customers, and we expect to establish additional strategic alliances and relationships with major customers. We will extend our role in the Smart Manufacturing space by increasing the levels of integration among all our technologies and by building relationships with partners. We will continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts to focus on vertical markets outside chemicals and petroleum, with particular emphasis on the pharmaceutical industry. We will continue to be opportunistic regarding strategic acquisitions that fit within our focus of delivering solutions based on fundamental process knowledge to industry. 
 In conclusion, I would like to thank our employees for their contributions and hard work during a time of transition and change. I thank our customers for their support and enthusiasm for our vision of Smart Manufacturing and for their patience. And I thank our shareholders for their continued confidence.

Doc12,Aspen ,1998,"Fiscal 1998 was a year of contrasts for AspenTech numerous accomplishments that meaningfully strengthened our competitive position, along with execution challenge at the end of the fourth quarter. we began the year by introducing the plantelligence concept at a highly successful aspenworld 97 conference in october. this major industry event that we host every three years for our customers was attended by 1500 people. as the year unfolded we acquired eight companies, including cheaspeake decision sciences, to add strategic technologies, to extend the range of solutions we provide, and to broaden the target markets we serve. we released a number of major new products, we established new strategic customer relationships; and we raised capital sufficiently to fund our growth.  notwithstanding an earnings disappointment in the fourth quarter, caused by an overrun in expenses, aspentech achieved record financial results for the year. total revenues increased 30% to 254 million compared with 194 million for fiscal 1997. net income, excluding nonrecurring costs, rose 31% to 27.7 million for fiscal 1998 were 1.11 compared with 0.93 for fiscal 1997. all of these numbers include the historical results of chesapeake restated as a pooling of interests transaction. 
 the launch at aspenworld of plantelligence, aspentech's integrated suite of products and services to support smart manufacturing, was enthusiastically received by our customers. the smart manufacturing market space, first described by industry observers in 1997, describes the integration of advanced modeling, automation and information technologies to create a computer system enabling customers to design, operate and manage their manufacturing processes closer to their true potential plantelligence provides a framework for integrating our products based upon open standards such as . 
 we acquired eight companies in fiscal 1998, each of which provided strategic capabilities. in august 1997, we announced the acquisition of special analysis and simulation technologies, ltd (SAST), a global leader in dynamic simulation and operator training services and application, based in the uk. we also announced the acquisition of neuralware, a leading provider of neural network and related technologies, to enable us to incorporate neural network technology into our solutions for advanced control, process modeling, and information management. in march 1998, we announced three acquisitions: cimtech sa-nv, a leading european supplier of process information management systems, headquartered in belgium; contas process control an advanced process control consulting firm, based in italy and iisys inc a developer of advanced software technology used by process manufacturers to collect, reconcile and report yield-accounting information, located in houston. in april 1998, we reported the acquisition of the uk-based zyqad ltd, which provides software for managing the workflow among a team of engineers designing new process plants or improving existing facilities. 
 the announcement at the end of april 1998 that aspentech had acquired chesapeake dedcision sciences, a leading supplier of highly configurable software solutions for the rapidly growing supply chain market, had a dramatic impact on our marketplace. we changed the competitive playing field with the ability to extend our solutions beyond the optimization of an individual plant to encompass optimization of the entire manufacturing enterprise. our mandate was greatly expanded to include not only the manufacturing process but also processes along the entire supply chain from raw materials procedurement and inventory control to demand forecasting and distribution. the addition of supply chain optimization is a natural extension to plantelligence. 
 finally, in june 1998 we completed the acquisition of treiber controls inc a leading provider of advanced process control and real-time optimization technologies and services based in canada. this acquisition added valuable project execution capacity in canada to serve our core markets of petroleum refining and petrochemicals and it also provided unique applications skills in the important emerging markets of polymers natural gas and pulp and paper. 
 we were active in delivering new releases of many of our products. in april 1998 we shipped our flagship process modeling system, aspen plus 10.0, with many new engineering capabilities and a greatly improved ability to interoperate with other software using the latest windows standards. other major product releases during the year included rt-opt 3.0 which provides tight integration between off-line simulation and design using aspen plus and equation-based real-time optimization on the plant floor, and aspen pims 10.0 the process industry's most widely used system for linear-programming-based optimization of economic planning and scheduling of production facilities. we completed aspen watch a new product to allow customers to monitor the performance their dmcplus advanced control system and to improve its performance over time. we also shipped new releases of infoplus21, the industry's leading real-time data historian for process information management, and aspen process explorer 2.0, the desktop client for displaying and accessing the data. in may 1998 we announced the availability of the aspen engineering suite, which realigned and repackaged all of our modeling and simulation products to make them easier to understand, configure and sell. the suite is comprised of major new versions of eight of aspentech's key modeling products and aspen zyqad. all of our new product releases fully support the microsoft windows nt and windows 95 operating systems. 
 we announced major customer alliences with valero energy group, bayer ag, westlake group, ici and statoil. the work we have been doing with lyondell chemical to implement plantelligence at its facility in matagorda country, texas achieved an important milestone as lyondell elected to license plantelligence to implement aspentech solutions at nine additional manufacturing facilities. during the year we also announced a strategic alliance with intergraph to develop and market integrated solutions for process and physical plant design, operations and management. 
 the key challenge for aspentech going forward is to be able to successfully execute our strategy to lead the emerging marketplace for smart manufacturing. going into the next fiscal year, we have realigned the focus of our management team to best match the talents of our people with the jobs most critical to our success. mary palermo has exchanged her chief financial officer duties for a promotion to a senior operating role as executive vice president with general management responsibility for the advanced control and optimization and the information management divisions. succeeding her as chief financial officer is lisa zappala, who is a skilled financial executive with a strong operational focus. david mcquiilin, executive vice president for worldwide sales and marketing, has taken on additional responsibility for the operations of the chesapeake supply chain division. david mushin was promoted to the position of senior vice president of operations based at headquarters to focus on improving the efficiency of our operations and building the infrastructure to streamline work processes and manage our expenses. each of these professionals brings to their new positions extensive knowledge of the company, of our industry, and of our customers. we are also fortunate that along with the companies we've acquired in recent years have come seasoned managers who are an integral part of the new structure to support our growth. 
 despite the many positive accomplishments of the year, we were disappointed that for the first time since our initial public offering, we failed to meet analysts' expectations for earnings in the fourth quarter. the earnings miss underscores that the most critical factors for our success are execution, execution and execution. the organizational changes will provide a new focus on the challenge of execution. the management team is committed to restoring the company to its historical levels of financial performance. 
 oour goal in fiscal 1999 will be to achieve profitable growth through careful expense management, expanding software revenues, and focusing on improvement of services execution. we will focus our r&d investments on integrating our technologies and developing the plantelligence framework as well as keeping the individual technologies best in class. we expect to expand alliances with key industry partners who can complement the solutions we provide with additional technology or additional market presence. 
 i want to thank our employees, whose energy has enabled us to reach these important milestones, and upon whom we are relying to achieve an even more ambitious set of goals in the year ahead. our customers have embraced our vision for the next generation of technology and products and we appreciate very much that vote of confidence. the management team at aspentech is committed to improving our financial performance and to increasing shareholder value in the process. we look forward to reporting our progress in the coming fiscal year. 
"
Doc13,Aspen ,1999,"Fiscal 1999 was a year of challenges and opportunities for AspenTech. Despite important accomplishments and numerous successful customer implementations, financial challenges arose as two of our end-user industries, petroleum refining and petrochemicals, faced severe pressures on their businesses. In many cases, these pressures led to mergers, acquisitions or other restructuring, causing customers to delay or defer purchasing decisions. As a result, our software license revenues for fiscal 1999 were below fiscal 1998 levels, and we reported a loss for the year.  In spite of the economic challenges, we significantly strengthened our relationships with many of our largest customers. We announced major expansions of agreements with Equistar Chemicals and Lyondell Chemicals, BP Amoco, Exxon Research and Engineering, and Air Products & Chemicals -- clear evidence of the tremendous economic value we deliver. 
 To address the challenges we faced in the industry, we commissioned and completed a thorough study of our strategy, which helped to clearly articulate AspenTech's opportunities. We carefully analyzed the markets for our solutions, our competitive advantages and unique competencies, as well as areas of our business where our efficiency could be improved or where new initiatives might be appropriate. The results of the strategy study confirm a large, rapidly growing market for our solutions and lay out an action plan for maintaining our leadership in serving this market. During the past several months, we have begun to implement this plan and have completed an organizational realignment that strengthens the company as we begin a new fiscal year. As we enter the 21st century, I believe that we are well positioned to extend our industry leadership and enable both AspenTech and our customers to achieve True Potential 
 The analysis of the market opportunities for AspenTech's solutions identified three engines that will drive the company's future growth. 
 focused solutions These solutions, based on our traditional software technologies, are used to design, operate and manage process manufacturing plants, as well as to optimize the supply chain of an enterprise. Focused solutions consist of individual products and services such as Aspen PlusTM for process simulation, DMCplusTM for advanced control, Aspen RT-Opt TM for real-time process optimization, InfoPlus.21TM for information manage-ment,Aspen PIMSTM and Aspen MIMITM for planning and scheduling plant and supply chain activities, and Aspen Zyqad for engineering work-flow management. 
 integrated plant solutions These solutions utilize multiple AspenTech products in a common framework to comprise the PlantelligenceTM solution. By inte-grating these products, customers are able to improve their work processes in the plant and dramatically increase the productivity of their manu-facturing operations. AspenTech is the only company to offer an integrated suite of products. Integration will drive both the company's growth and the future direction of the industry. 
 enterprise optimization solutions AspenTech's enterprise optimization solutions expand the scope of our products beyond the plant gate to encompass multiple facets of the enterprise. These solutions combine our integrated plant technology with the Aspen Supply Chain suite of products to enable companies to coordinate their plant assets and collaborate with trading partners, customers and suppliers. By optimizing plant operations and collapsing the supply chain, companies are able to maximize the level of savings they can attain. 
 Analysis shows that in 1999 the total annual potential market for these three types of solutions in AspenTech's core market segments of petroleum refining, petrochemicals, polymers, specialty chemicals and life sciences is $10.6 billion annually. With a served market in 1999 of $1.1 billion, the overall market is less than 10% penetrated and is growing at approximately 30% per year. The markets for integrated plant and enterprise optimization solutions are at very early stages of development and are growing faster, in the range of 35-40% per year. The growth of the mature market for focused solutions, which has grown at about 25% per year for the past decade, is expected to slow to 15-20% per year, but on a large base. 
 In addition to these core vertical markets, AspenTech derives roughly 20-25% of its business today from other segments of the process industries, including consumer packaged goods, food and beverage, high-tech and semiconductors, pulp and paper, metals and minerals, and electric power. In each of these industries, we have a strong position in one or more key technologies with blue-chip customers and they represent important avenues of additional growth for the company. While revenues from our largest vertical markets of petroleum refining and petrochemicals declined due to the restructuring of these industries, we believe the long-term impact will be positive. AspenTech's solutions enable restructured enterprises to increase productivity and improve their competitiveness with a low-cost, low-risk, high-return investment. As enterprises emerge from these restructurings, we expect our solutions to be at or near the top of the list of priorities based on the attractive return on investment they provide. 
 Our market research confirmed a number of competitive advantages and core strengths of the company: 
 We have the largest and strongest franchise in the industry based on strong, longstanding customer relationships with almost all of the major process manufacturers worldwide. We have an excellent reputation with our blue-chip cus-tomer base because of the strength of our technology, the skill of our people and the clarity of our vision. 
 We are the clear market and technology leader. During the past decade, AspenTech was first to market with a long list of breakthrough technologies that transformed the industry and led to our dominant position. We have the leading market share in the majority of our core technologies. 
 We are strategically positioned for long-term growth. We are the only company that offers an integrated solution that enables process manufacturers to optimize both their plants and their enterprises, including the extended enterprise that encompasses the supply chain. 
 Focus on integrated plant solutions and enterprise optimization solutions as the primary engines that will drive our future growth. Due to the significant economic returns these technologies can provide for companies, it will be essential for manufacturers to adopt these solutions in order to be competitive in the future. 
 Maintain our leadership in focused solutions. In order to extend our current lead, we must continue to invest in R&D and focus that investment in the areas that are critical for our customers' success. 
 Continue our development and deployment of the Aspen Framework, AspenTech's platform for delivering integrated solutions. 
 Focus on vertical industries. We have created Industry Business Units for each of our core vertical markets and given these units the responsibility for developing the value proposition and defining the enterprise optimization solution for each industry. 
 Expand our network of partners. We believe we can optimize the growth of the business by working with third parties to help sell and implement our solutions and expand the market opportunity. We expect this effort will include working with world-class business consultants, system integrators, complementary software vendors and other companies with expertise that can accelerate our growth and enable us to penetrate new accounts more rapidly. 
 Incorporate the internet into everything we do. This initiative includes making our products web-enabled, providing full support for e-commerce, facilitating inter-business collaboration among our customers and exploring new business models made possible by the web. 
 The strategy outlined above focuses on the long-term growth and success of our business. We have made a number of operational changes that we believe will better enable us to execute the strategy, make us more efficient and restore AspenTech to attractive financial performance and increased returns for shareholders. 
 We have established four Industry Business Units (IBU) to heighten our vertical industry focus on our key markets. The leaders of these IBUs have outstanding reputations in their industries, possess the expertise to develop specific industry solutions and will create market strategies to deliver the technologies. 
 We have formed a single product development organization. This organization will facilitate the rapid integration of our products, the sharing of common components, the creation of a common look and feel to our product and the reduction of duplicative effort. 
 We have created a single global solutions organization uniting all of the various technical disciplines within AspenTech. This organization will facilitate the delivery of solutions that involve multiple technologies and integrated systems and provide better career paths for our services professionals. 
 We have formed a single, global customer support organization to improve the quality of our services and more effectively respond to customers. 
 We will continue to operate the supply chain business as an independent business unit. AspenTech's supply chain business is growing rapidly and can best be supported by allowing it to operate independently from our other units. However, the sales, product development and services and support teams for supply chain will be closely coordinated with the other organizational units. 
 Our customers have welcomed this new organizational structure because it better integrates the 17 organizations that were merged into AspenTech over the past five years and has enabled us to achieve our goal of truly becoming one company. 
 As we enter the new fiscal year, we have improved our financial stability by substantially reducing our level of operating expenses. This reduction lowers the company's breakeven point, enabling AspenTech to return to profitability at the lower revenue levels we expect in the near term as the health of our end-user markets begins to improve. We have also increased our revenue opportunities by expanding our offerings beyond our core markets and our balance sheet remains solid, with nearly $100 million in cash. 
 AspenTech has a long history of delivering solid financial performance. In the four years after we went public, we grew our revenues five-fold and met or exceeded Wall Street estimates for 15 consecutive quarters. The management team is very much committed to restoring the company to solid financial performance and improving its valuation. I believe the strategy we have articulated and the organizational changes we have implemented puts AspenTech in an excellent position to take advantage of a tremendous market opportunity. 
 I thank our employees, who have worked very hard during challenging times with loyalty and dedication, our customers who have worked closely with us with enthusiasm and understanding, and our shareholders who have supported us in difficult times with confidence. We look forward to reporting our progress in the coming fiscal year. 
"
Doc14,Aspen ,2000,"This year we made a commitment to ourselves, our customers and our shareholders that we would lead the process industries into the networked economy. We are succeeding. This success is evidenced by the company??s significant accomplishments in fiscal 2000. Operationally, we achieved a rapid and dramatic turnaround from the challenges we faced in fiscal 1999. Our financial results in fiscal 2000 reflect this resurgence in customer investment and give us confidence that our strategy is sound and that we are well positioned for additional growth. This momentum is evidence of robust market demand, the competitiveness of our solutions and the capabilities of our sales team. The management team is very proud that we were able to return AspenTech to profitability in such a short period of time.  At the start of the year, we clearly articulated our key strategic priorities:   Focus on core markets in the process industries, where our domain expertise is unparalleled;   Emphasize integrated solutions, including our plant and supply chain offerings, where the growth opportunities are the most compelling;   Expand our industry partnerships, particularly with providers of implementation services and differentiated technology;   Strengthen and diversify our vertical market solutions where process expertise can create dramatic economic value; and   Leverage the Internet across a variety of new and existing business models. 
 I am pleased with our execution in these endeavors, how quickly we acted to implement these goals, and with the early, demonstrable success we have achieved. Our accomplishments have generated excitement among our customers and partners, enthusiasm among our employees, and support of our plans and progress by investors. 
 Signs of our early success are apparent on many levels.Focus on our core markets paid off handsomely, as these sectors returned to more vigorous investment patterns. Evidence of this strong customer demand was reflected in our 37% license revenue growth for the year, as process manufacturers more aggressively deployed software solutions to optimize their enterprises. This license growth was also complemented by a strong ramp-up in the backlog of our services business, which topped more than $115 million at the end of fiscal 2000. 
 Our strong emphasis on integrated solutions was also a big success, with revenues attributable to Plantelligence??, our integrated, plant-wide solution, and supply chain optimization offerings more than doubling over fiscal 1999 levels. Key Plantelligence wins included BP Oil, BP Chemicals, Union Carbide, Sunoco, Formosa Petrochemicals, Rohm and Haas, Air Liquide and Lyondell-Equistar. 
 Key supply chain wins included Bayer, BP Chemicals, Baxter Healthcare, Borden Chemical, Chevron-Phillips Chemicals, Marathon Ashland Petroleum, Nova Chemicals, Hercules Chemicals and Johns Manville. The ARC Advisory Group recently estimated that AspenTech??s supply chain market share in the chemical and petroleum industries was 46%, evidence of our strong competitive position and clear technical superiority for process industry applications. Our plant and supply chain offerings each accounted for approximately 30% of our license revenue in fiscal 2000, with the balance coming from individual, best-in-class point solutions. 
 To enhance our marketplace visibility and implementation capabilities, we established significant new marketing, sales, and services partnerships with IBM, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Origin. Each of these relationships has already been solidified through the influence of high-profile license transactions. Early in the year, we formed a relationship with Extricity Software to integrate its B2B collaboration application with our extended supply chain solution for process industry customers. On the vertical market front, we strengthened our position in the petroleum sector, acquiring Petrolsoft Corporation to create the first end-to-end, truly comprehensive supply chain solution, from the wellhead to the gas pump. We also expanded our batch manufacturing capabilities for pharmaceutical manufacturers by acquiring M2R Inc., and we formed an alliance with Union Carbide to jointly provide enterprise optimization solutions to leading polymers producers worldwide. 
 More than 2,300 leaders from the process industries attended AspenWorld 2000, our industry-wide conference held every three years. At the conference, we demonstrated our fully integrated Plantelligence and supply chain solutions to customers from each of our vertical markets and we unveiled our new company logo and the tagline process. to the power of e. This rebranding reflects AspenTech??s focus on being the trusted e-business provider for process manufacturers. Some of our recent e-business initiatives include launching a collaborative digital marketplace for the petroleum industry, PetroVantage??; forming e-Catalysts, Inc., a new on-line B2B exchange for the catalysts industry, building an industry portal for process industry professionals, ProcessCity.com; and forming an alliance with e-Chemicals. We are squarely positioned as the e-business leader for the process industries. Our solutions and capabilities in e-business have been extremely well received, as process manufacturers are just beginning to consider how these trends will affect their businesses and how they can embrace these B2B technologies to gain a competitive advantage. 
 Leaders in the process industries are increasingly aware that the Internet has the potential to revolutionize the way they operate. As e-business spreads globally, our customers are now seeking opportunities to create new sources of value   solutions that enable them to make faster, more profitable decisions with both their customers and their suppliers. Those firms that can better integrate planning, scheduling and production systems can optimize their manufacturing plants and supply chains, improving asset utilization and manufacturing throughputs. This integration will enable them to reduce inventories and lower operating costs. Additionally, the ability to respond quickly across the critical supply chain, manufacturing and engineering dimensions can increase customer satisfaction and improve marketplace agility. 
 In order to remain competitive, industry leaders are accelerating their adoption of e-business infrastructure solutions, and other companies are beginning to follow. As process manufacturers create e-business strategies and determine which technologies to deploy, AspenTech has never been better positioned to meet the needs of these customers. We have the credibility as the right company to lead the process industries into the new digital economy, and our vision has resonated with our customers, partners and analysts. We also uniquely possess two important requisites for successfully deploying B2B solutions in our industries: e-business savvy and unparalleled process industry expertise. No one else offers both, and neither is sufficient alone. 
 We have built an outstanding team of extraordinarily dedicated people, an unsurpassed suite of products, and the infrastructure necessary to support our growth. In that regard, I am pleased to welcome to our Board of Directors two new members, Stephen Brown, Chairman of John Hancock Financial Services, and Stephen Jennings, Director of Monitor Group. Each of these individuals brings considerable management talent, and their experience will be instrumental in guiding the future direction of AspenTech. 
 As we look ahead, we are extremely enthusiastic about the prospects we see to transform our industry and grow our business significantly as process manufacturers are compelled to deploy new technologies in order to gear up for e-business. We believe demand for our solutions will continue to be robust because the return on investment for our offerings is so compelling. We have outlined three major operational objectives for the coming fiscal year that we believe will position us for continued growth.   Continue to lead the market for plant-wide solutions, as customers recognize the role our integrated Plantelligence solutions will play in providing the solid plant level infrastructure on which to build their e-business initiatives   Extend our leadership in supply chain for the process industries by building on our unparalleled domain expertise and our unique ability to meet the complex requirements of this industry   Capture e-business leadership in the process industries by providing technology for the major process industry e-marketplaces and enabling customers to implement collaborative solutions with their customers and other trading partners. 
 Our entire company is focused on these goals. We will succeed by focusing on creating customer value, achieving operational excellence, capturing customer and investor mind share and making AspenTech a magnet for outstanding talent. We thank our customers, partners, employees, and shareholders for the loyalty and confidence you have shown this past year, and we look forward to additional success in the year ahead. Throughout the following pages of this annual report, I will answer several questions as a way to share with you the reasons we believe AspenTech is poised to capture a significant portion of this exciting market opportunity. 
"
Doc15,Aspen ,2001,"Fiscal 2001 was a year of great contrasts for AspenTech. Despite very robust demand during the first six months of the year, we were not immune to the challenging economic environment, which slowed our growth and negatively affected our profitability during the second half of the year.  In spite of these challenges, I am proud of the many accomplishments that have extended our market leadership and positioned us for success as we look to the fiscal year ahead. I want to share with you several reasons why I am excited about the future of AspenTech. 
 We launched a major new campaign, Aspen ProfitAdvantage, which sharpens our message to C-level executives on how AspenTech solutions improve profits by increasing revenues, decreasing operating costs and reducing fixed and working capital requirements. Our solutions bring bottom-line benefits that typically amount to as much as 4 to 6 percent of revenues. The Aspen ProfitAdvantage message is resonating with process industry executives who see the opportunity to quickly implement solutions that can significantly increase their operating profits and deliver value to their shareholders. 
 We achieved record growth in our engineering business as we expanded the breadth and functionality of our asset optimization solutions. These products enable companies to improve functions such as process design and engineering, and construction and start-up. By using these solutions to create accurate models, they also form the foundation to optimize the plant and the enterprise-wide supply chain. We closed large transactions during the year for these solutions with BP, The Dow Chemical Company, Fluor Daniel, Foster Wheeler, Jacobs Engineering, Mitsui Chemicals Inc. and Pemex. 
 We increased our leading share of the process industry supply chain market, with multimillion dollar head-to-head competitive wins at Chevron, FPCO in Japan, Johns Manville, Petro-Canada Sasol Polymers, Sinopec Corp. and Yukos, a major refiner in Russia. According to ARC Advisory Group, AspenTech had a more than 50 percent market share for supply chain planning and scheduling in the refining and chemicals market in the year 2000. This leading market share continues to be evidence of the importance of our domain expertise and broad solution set in solving problems for process manufacturers. Our solution set not only allows customers to create optimal operating plans, but also provides the supply chain execution technologies required to help customers execute that plan in real-time, a capability that is unique in the marketplace. 
 We integrated and leveraged several strategic acquisitions of people, products and technologies, adding value that accelerated demand for our engineering and supply chain solutions. Our acquisition of ICARUS added cost-estimation capabilities to our already best-in-class collaborative engineering suite. The addition of Petrolsoft just before the beginning of the year led to record growth in our downstream supply chain solutions for the petroleum industry. The purchase of e-Chemicals' technology broadened and expanded the development of our marketplace solutions, while the addition of the Houston Consulting Group will combine their industry-leading refinery scheduling technology with our refinery planning solution, where we have a dominant market share. We were pleased with the success of these acquisitions and expect that they will be an important component of our future growth as we expand the total solution we will deliver to our customers. 
 We made progress on our strategy to leverage implementation partners as our partner relationships grew in strength and in number, bringing AspenTech's capabilities to the forefront of key industry thought-leaders. In addition to working closely with IBM Gobal Solutions and PricewaterhouseCoopers during the year, we formed a new relationship with Accenture to add to the breadth of our systems integrator partners. Partners accounted for approximately 10 percent of our license revenues this fiscal year and will be an important part of our growth in the future. Additionally, we formed a technology relationship with Optimum Logistics to improve our downstream and supply chain logistics solutions for the bulk chemicals industry. 
 We broadened and deepened our senior management team, with key hires who not only bring essential skills and experience, but leverage the time, knowledge and value of our most senior executives, whose duties have significantly expanded. These additions will particularly help us to improve our initiatives in sales, human resources, and research and development. 
 We achieved a number of important product milestones that dramatically improved our competitive position and extended our industry-leading solutions. Among the highlights of fiscal 2001 was the creation of PetroVantage-, a solution for optimizing and coordinating the trading and logistics decisions and workflow for petroleum and refined products. We announced the concept in September 2000, signed up 10 pilot customers by the spring, and launched the commercial version of the solution in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. While we have invested substantial capital resources in PetroVantage, we expect that it has the potential to generate hundreds of millions of dollars of predictable, subscription revenues annually for AspenTech and create considerable value for shareholders. It is also a critical component of our end-to-end solution for the petroleum industry. No other vendor can come close to the value we can provide to this industry. 
 We sharpened our e-business focus by introducing our private marketplace solutions, Aspen Buy and Aspen Sell-. These products have been received enthusiastically by our customers and have expanded our capabilities to allow process manufacturers to purchase their direct materials and sell their products through privately branded marketplaces. The purchase of direct materials is often the largest operational cost for our customers and has a dramatic impact on the quality and profitability of their products. By integrating our marketplace solutions with our supply chain and manufacturing solutions, customers will be able to choose the best raw materials to optimize their profitability. Additionally, our Aspen Sell product will help process manufacturers improve responsiveness to client inquiries by creating better supply chain visibility with their long-term customers. 
 On the financial front, we achieved record revenues of $310 million during fiscal 2001, driven by a 20 percent increase in services revenue and strong license revenue growth in the first half of the year. During the second half of the year, growth was slower for our license revenues due to the global economic slowdown. With our strategic position, we believe that we remain poised to return to a more robust level of growth once the economy stabilizes. 
 We also saw a number of customers standardize on our technology, including an agreement with Rohm and Haas for our Plantelligence- and supply chain planning solutions, evidence that our integrated offerings continue to gain traction in the marketplace. We saw additional standardization decisions for various elements of our offering by Chevron, Dow, DuPont and Sinopec Corp. 
 As we enter fiscal 2002, we are focused on execution and expanding the market penetration of our industry-leading solutions. Cur ability to provide value in real-time and link supply chain planning and execution activities will be important factors to our future success. 
 AspenTech PetroVantage solution should gain significant momentum in the coming year, from its launch in the fall to generating meaningful revenues by year-end. Throughout fiscal 2002, we will be emphasizing Aspen ProfitAdvantage, demonstrating our ability to continue to provide the bottom-line improvements that gave us our start in 1981 and have kept us successful for the past 20 years. 
 When the economy turns around, I have every confidence that we will resume attractive top-line and earnings growth. We are acknowledged as the leading technology provider and most innovative visionary in our market. Our customer satisfaction remains high, our market share continues to grow and our competitive position and management team have never been stronger. As we celebrate our 20th anniversary as a leading software provider to the process industries, I am excited by the unparalleled franchise we have put in place and our strong prospects for the future. 
 I thank our employees, who have worked very hard during challenging times with loyalty and dedication, our customers who have worked closely with us with enthusiasm and understanding, and our shareholders who have supported us with confidence. We look forward to reporting our progress in the coming fiscal year. 
"
Doc16,Aspen ,2002," In spite of these pressures, we have remained focused on refining our execution in all areas of our business. During the year we significantly strengthened our product offerings, broadened the value our solutions can deliver and improved the depth of our management team.  Refined Strategy Based on Four Key Initiatives Against the backdrop of tough market conditions, we made several changes during the year to update our strategic direction and solidify our market leadership in the process industries. We believe these changes will serve as our foundation to expand market share and improve the company??s financial performance in the coming year. 
 We articulated four strategic initiatives that we believe will not only return AspenTech to profitability as quickly as possible, but will streamline our selling process, improve the efficiency of our software development and services teams, and increase our market presence in key process industry segments beyond petroleum, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. 
 [1] Organize the company around two product lines: Engineering and Manufacturing/Supply Chain 
 We have dramatically simplified our organizational structure in order to more effectively align our internal resources with our sharpened emphasis and are focused on driving the performance of these two key product lines. 
 We believe this new companywide alignment will lead to a clearer message to the market, as well as improve our execution and facilitate more predictable financial performance. By eliminating overlapping efforts and streamlining our product development, marketing and sales processes, we have created greater accountability throughout AspenTech. This structure is now fully in place and we are enthusiastic about the positive impact these changes will have on our productivity in the months and years ahead. 
 [2] Complete the transformation of AspenTech into a provider of enterprise-wide Engineering and Manufacturing/Supply Chain solutions 
 Our major global process industry customers are increasingly looking to partner with a few strategic software providers that can help them engineer and run their manufacturing and supply chain operations efficiently and profitably. To ensure that AspenTech cements its position as one of these core suppliers, our development efforts are focused on completing the transformation of our stand-alone point technologies into products that can be configured into scalable solutions deployed across the enterprise. 
 To achieve this objective, we have restructured our software into three families: core technologies, or Foundation Products; pre-configured, industry Business Process Products; and Aspen Enterprise Platform?? products, which provide the basic infrastructure for integration and business process automation. All three families of products work together to deliver substantial economic value for our customers, integrating seamlessly with other components of the enterprise IT infrastructure and delivering a low cost of ownership. 
 [3] Partner with select industry leaders to accelerate market penetration 
 Delivering enterprise-wide solutions to our customers that are low risk and can be implemented quickly, requires that we establish partnerships with a few select companies. Companies such as Accenture, IBM Business Consulting Services (which includes the former operations of PwC Consulting) and Intergraph provide us with additional resources   in terms of technology, implementation expertise and industry knowledge to deploy compelling solutions for our global customers. 
 Ultimately, these partnerships will result in increased revenues for AspenTech by helping us to deliver more value to our customers and expanding our available market. In fiscal 2002, the revenues we generated from partners were approximately 16 percent of our software revenues, up from 10 percent last year and on track to reach our stated goal of 20 percent or greater in fiscal 2003. 
 [4] Maintain a vertical market focus, driving growth in Petroleum, Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals, and in key adjacent vertical markets 
 While AspenTech??s traditional core markets of petroleum, chemicals and pharmaceuticals lie at the heart of our future growth plans, we are targeting other segments of the process market as areas of emerging growth for the company. These markets include the utilities, process-related consumer packaged goods (CPG) and oil & gas industries. The acquisition of Hyprotech supports this objective, diversifying AspenTech into a number of the most important process industry sectors where we did not have a strong presence previously. 
 Strategic Acquisition of Hyprotech The acquisition of Hyprotech Ltd., a subsidiary of AEA Technology, was an important catalyst to the rollout of our refined strategy. The importance and relative strength of our combined engineering solutions were critical factors in our decision to acquire the company. While the timing of the purchase was not ideal given the marketplace volatility, Hyprotech??s five-year revenue growth of approximately 25 percent annually and its double-digit operating profits made the acquisition compelling for AspenTech, from both a financial and strategic perspective. 
 Hyprotech is the leading supplier of engineering software to the refining and oil & gas industries and is a perfect complement to AspenTech, which has long been the leading supplier of engineering software to the petroleum, chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries. 
 Based in Calgary, Canada, Hyprotech pioneered software that is used by engineers in a significant number of oil & gas production facilities and refineries. Hyprotech has a reputation for providing excellent, easy-to-use software and we anticipate its technologies will be an important component of our engineering software revenues this year. 
 Relentless Focus on Execution Our plan to implement a flatter organizational structure, eliminate non-strategic projects and curtail spending has dramatically lowered the company??s quarterly breakeven point, while retaining our primary focus on the customer. Our success will require flawless execution throughout the year, both in terms of more predictable revenue streams and strict cost controls. One important change in company culture is the increased profit and loss responsibility that has been assigned to managers across the company. A significant portion of managers?? compensation will now be variable and based on our financial performance. This decision should improve our ability to achieve our growth and profitability objectives. 
 Exceptional Market Positioning Ironically, in spite of difficult economic conditions that have limited our financial growth, our market position remains strong due to our relentless focus on our core strengths. AspenTech has meaningfully broadened its reach into new target markets and expanded its engineering expertise with the acquisition of Hyprotech. Software vendors that focus only on supply chain or process automation have struggled in the current economic environment because they lack the breadth required to deliver enterprise solutions. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) vendors remain a source of marketplace confusion. However, when customers compare our process industry knowledge with their lack of vertical focus, we remain the supplier of choice in the process industries. Our ability to retain and extend our market leadership in the face of an extremely challenging environment gives us confidence in our prospects for the future. 
 Evolution in Leadership More than 20 years after the company was founded, the time had come to choose the next Chief Executive Officer of AspenTech. Our goal was to manage this transition in a way that respected the company??s roots in technical innovation and carefully considered the needs of our customers, employees, partners and shareholders. This process concluded last spring as the Board of Directors unanimously selected David McQuillin to lead the company. David joined AspenTech five years ago, strengthened our sales and marketing organization, and since November 2000 has served as co-chief operating officer. We worked closely together in refining the company??s strategic approach to the market and charting a course that will enable us to return to profitable operations and create a smooth transition of leadership as David takes the reins on October 1, 2002. 
 David will be supported in his new role by Wayne Sim, the former CEO of Hyprotech, who joins our executive team as Senior Vice President of Sales. Wayne??s record in delivering sustained revenue and earnings growth at Hyprotech, his relationships with senior decision makers at our largest customers and his managerial acumen make him the ideal candidate to revitalize the performance of our sales organization. He is also one of AspenTech??s largest shareholders. 
 Poised for Attractive Return on Investment We believe there has never been a time when the opportunity to deliver compelling solutions to our customers, generate significant financial returns and increase shareholder value has been so strong. Our solutions are addressing significant target markets, and with unchallenged technical superiority and a reputation for excellence that is unequalled in our industry, we believe we are poised to tap this opportunity. Customers earn returns on their investments in our solutions that are rapid and dramatic. Our unparalleled domain expertise and the proven performance of our solutions in some of the most complex environments are critical components to the value of the franchise we have built over two decades. More than 1,200 satisfied customers in 60 countries around the globe are a tribute to the commitment we place on delivering value and innovation. 
 We thank our customers, partners, employees and shareholders for their loyalty and support over the past year. As the new leadership team takes over, we look forward to reporting new accomplishments for our company in the coming fiscal year. 
"
Doc17,Aspen ,2003,"Fiscal 2003 was a year of transition and significant progress for AspenTech. Despite the challenges of an anemic economy and a stagnant IT spending environment, the company met or exceeded its operational and financial objectives for the last three quarters of the fiscal year. These profitable results were the culmination of several decisive actions, which included reorganizing the company around our Engineering and Manufacturing/Supply Chain product lines, strengthening the management team, dramatically reducing operating expenses, and improving execution across the company.  By taking these actions and dramatically improving our operating performance, the company was able to take an important step forward with the restructuring of our balance sheet. In August 2003, we closed a $100 million private equity transaction with Advent International, which eliminated nearterm debt obligations, bolstered working capital, and put the company in a solid financial position to fuel top-line and bottom-line growth. 
 With these changes, AspenTech enters fiscal 2004 with an improved and sustainable operating model, an excellent market position, and the financial resources to improve shareholder value by delivering valuable, differentiated solutions to our customers. 
 Updated Strategic Direction We began the fiscal year by showcasing our newest solutions at AspenWorld, the biennial conference for process industry executives that attracts more than 2,000 participants. These solutions address the emerging Enterprise Operations Management (EOM) market and are designed to increase the profitability of our process industry customers by improving their operational efficiency and flexibility. As a first mover in the EOM market, AspenTech is establishing a leadership position. Our new EOM solutions have been extremely well received by customers and have already delivered significant economic benefits to several early adopters that have completed implementations.We believe the next wave of IT spending in the process industries will be focused on improving operational performance and that AspenTech is well positioned as the EOM market grows. 
 Improved Operational Performance In October 2002, we reduced our expenses by approximately twenty-five percent to deal with the challenges of a weak IT spending environment. These reductions, together with improved productivity and execution across the company, enabled us to stabilize the business and sequentially grow pro forma earnings per share each of the last three quarters of the fiscal year. 
 One of the key drivers of this improved performance was the solid performance of the Engineering product line, which exceeded our targets for the year and enabled the company to surpass our expectations for software revenue. These products performed well because they help customers improve their operating margins and capital efficiency even during industry and economic downturns. The addition of the heritage Hyprotech products also allowed us to establish a more significant presence in two major markets: petroleum refining, and upstream oil & gas. 
 While the performance of our Manufacturing/ Supply Chain product line was not as robust as we had hoped, we are excited about the growth potential of several new products we developed during the year, including three we jointly developed with Accenture. One of these products, Aspen Enterprise Platform (AEP), a robust openintegration infrastructure and a key component of our Operations Cockpit, has been sold to fourteen customers and deployed in more than eighty plants in just the ten months since its commercial launch. Overall, we saw improved demand for our Manufacturing/Supply Chain solutions in our fourth quarter and are excited about our sales pipeline as the economy improves and our customers return to making strategic IT investments. 
 From an end-user standpoint, customers in the upstream oil & gas, petroleum refining, chemicals, polymers, engineering & construction, and pharmaceutical industries comprised the largest segments of our business in fiscal 2003.We will continue to focus on these industries as the source of our most significant opportunities and the main drivers of our future growth by developing targeted, scalable EOM solutions for each of these major vertical industries. 
 Strengthened Balance Sheet In August 2003, the company restructured its balance sheet and significantly added to its cash balances by completing a $100 million private equity financing with Advent International. This transaction, although dilutive to common shareholders, addressed several near-term debt obligations and put the company back in a stable financial situation. Additionally, the confidence of Advent to make such a significant investment was an important validation of the value of AspenTech??s franchise and market opportunity. 
 Another reason this capital investment was so critical to the company was that shortly after the fiscal year ended, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) decided to challenge our acquisition of Hyprotech Ltd. The company??s improved financial position will enable us to mount a vigorous defense to this challenge. AspenTech does not agree with the FTC??s assertion that the transaction was anticompetitive or with its interpretation of the facts.We believe that the acquisition benefits customers and has enabled us to accelerate innovation in the marketplace. 
 The company has accrued for the expenses relating to this challenge, which may take as long as three to five years to complete if all appeals are taken. In the meantime, we have the resources to defend against these allegations. In the interim, the litigation will not impact our commitment to our customers, and we will continue to deliver innovative, high-value engineering solutions. 
 Positioned for Profitable Growth The improvement in our operating performance, our strengthened balance sheet and the tremendous value of our customer franchise give me a high level of confidence as we begin our new fiscal year. AspenTech enters fiscal 2004 very well positioned, with a set of solutions that deliver rapid, substantial returns to customers facing significant pressures on their operating performance every day. 
 As we leverage the strength of our latest product offering, we will continue to focus on generating positive cash flow to build on our improved financial position.With more than seventy-five percent of our software revenues coming from recurring term licenses and with a significantly lowered break-even point, we believe we have dramatically increased the visibility and predictability of our business model. 
 The executive management team has come together nicely, with the most recent addition being Chuck Kane, who joined the company as Chief Financial Officer at the start of fiscal 2004. The entire team is energized by the progress the company has made and is committed to generating profitable growth in the year ahead. 
 As I close out my first year as CEO, I would like to recognize the loyalty of our customers and partners, and thank our employees for their dedication over what was a very challenging period. The progress we made over the past year would not have been possible without their support and encouragement.With the solid foundation we established in fiscal 2003, the groundwork has been laid for AspenTech to return to attractive financial and operational performance in the year ahead. 
"
Doc18,Citrix ,1996,"1996 was an excellent year for Citrix. We made significant strides in our journey toward buillling a world-class company. It has been a tremendous team effort and we would like to thank everyone in the Citrix family-stockholders, employees, customers, OEMs, resellers and strategic partners.  Our 1996 financial results reflect the success of our effort Revenue grew to $44.5 million- over three times our 1995 revenue of $14.6 million. Our net income of $18.7 million exceeded our 1995 net income of $1.9 million by a factor of nine. Our growth during 1996 further validated the value of our products and our innovative thin client/server computing architecture. 
 Our product, technology, sales and support strategies meshed well in 1996. The new release of Citrix WinFrame 1.6 was an immediate success and established us as a market leader in extending the reach of business-critical applications The increased acceptance of our ICA protocol by some of the most respected OEMs in the industry helped us in our goal of establishing ICA as a de facto industry standard for thin-client/server computing. The worldwide expansion of our exciting channel program-the Citrix Solutions Network-to over 1,400 systems integrators and value-added resellers allowed us to reach more customers than ever with our selling messages. And the expansion of our technical support and systems engineering capabilities improved our ability to provide more customer-focused services. 
 The demand for our products has generated sigificant interest from OEMs and co-marketing partners throughout the world. Through the end of 1996, we have signed many co-marketing agreements with leading hardware and software companies through the Citrix Business Alliance program. 
 The overall migration to 32-bit enterprise applications continues to create substantial market opportunities. Our customers want cost-effective, flexible access to powerful applications now. 
 That??s exactly what we offer through our WinFrame product family that includes our ovim ICA and MULTIWIN technologies. We enable widely diverse groups such as DOS, UNDQ, X terminal, Macintosh, Windows terminal, network computer and even wireless PDA users to access business- critical applications, from virtually anywhere, via any connection. 
 Even with the positive background of 1996, we face many substantial challenges in 1997. As we write this letter, Microsoft has announced its intention to incorporate multi-user and additional remote access capabilities in a future version of Windows NT. While we believe this announcement validates our vision for distributed enterprise computing, we also recognize the critical importance of Microsoft??s plans to our future. As reported, we have been engaged in cross-licensing negotiations with Microsoft for future products. While there can be no assurance that an agreement will be reached, we remain committed to executing our long-term strategy for enterprise computing. 
 We believe our unique technologies and product offerings help companies lower their total cost of application ownership by enabling applications and support to be deployed and managed from a single point. And, we intend to continue opening the doors for existing computers and new devices to access the latest strategic applications all without sacrificing performance. 
 At Citrix, our products and technologies are rapidly becoming an accepted I/S solution for thin-client/server enterprise computing. Together, we intend to build an innovative, successful World-class company that takes computing even further 
"
Doc19,Citrix ,1997,"the year 1997 was incredibly good for Citrix. Here??s a sincere thanks to the extended Citrix family stockholders, employees, customers, OEMs, resellers and alliance marketing partners - for a great team effort.  We grew our 1997 revenue to $123.9 million a 178% increase over our 1996 revenue of $44.5 million. Our after-tax profit grew 121% to a record $41.3 million and we achieved new milestones in our journey toward building a world-class company. Synergistic industry and market trends in enterprise computing, as well as increasing customer recognition of the value in our thin-client/server products, fueled our growth. 
 Existing customers found new ways to extend the use of our products and new customers were able to get the lower cost and faster deployment benefits; from our thin-client/server computing approach. By the end of 1997, over one million concurrent user connections were in use. Our 1997 growth is solid evidence that our vision for application deployment and management software is solving important computing problems for enterprise customers worldwide. 
 Managing our growth continues to be one of our most important priorities. During 1997 we added over 150 new employees and expanded our internal systems and facilities to provide a top-notch business environment for our most precious asset-our people. Our recently announced acquisition of technologies from Insignia Solutions in February 1998 added over 40 people to our new R&D center just west of London, England. 1997 was marked by growth in every Citrix organization as we attracted strong, experienced new people to the company while continuing to maintain our core values. Our October 1997 acquisition of Sydney, Australia-based Datapac helped us accelerate our move into the Asia-Pacific market while also providing new technologies for future products. 
 Providing high-performance, universal access to 32-bit enterprise applications to any desktop over any network continues to be the core message that drives adoption of our products. In order to accelerate the delivery of this message and increase: the adoption of thin-client/server computing, we doubled the Citrix Solutions Network channel to almost 3,000 Solution providers. We also doubled the number of industry vendors in the Citrix Business Alliance program, including an exciting, new strategic relationship with Compaq Computer Corporation. 
 We achieved excellent results in our ??ICA Everywhere?? program. New ICA licensees such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard and UMAX, for example, mean a broad range of new information appliances will extend the promise of thin-client/server computing even further. 
 On May 9, 1997, we entered a technology licensing and joint development agreement with Microsoft to build new server-based platforms on upcoming versions of Windows NT?? Server that can yield up to $175 million in revenue to Citrix over five years. The first of these products the Microsoft Windows-based Terminal Server is expected to be available in mid-1998. Our work with Microsoft is validating our vision for thin-client/server computing, Co-marketing with Microsoft has the potential to accelerate customer awareness of our existing and new products. 
 In june, 1997, we announced a development project that we code-named ??plCAsso??. Later in 1998, products from this effort will allow our customers to create robust, thin-client/server systems on top of the new Microsoft Windows-based Terminal Server software. The addition of new technology offerings from the ??plCAsso?? Project means our sales channels will be able to offer additional thin-client/server solutions for an even broader range of enterprise application deployment needs. 
 Our thin-client/server architecture has the potential to provide powerful enterprise computing solutions to millions of users Windows PCs to Macintosh?? computers, DOS computers, UNIX?? workstations, network computers and Windows-based Terminals. Market opportunities abound. Our financial strength, overall product acceptance and growth plans make us well positioned to tap market potential. While we continue to face challenges, we intend to continue to provide the most robust products and services for enterprise application deployment. 
 Our desire to build a world-class company is greater than ever. Thank you for working with us as an integral part of the Citrix family. 
"
Doc20,Citrix ,1998,"There is only one word to describe 1998 fantastic! It was another year of tremendous growth for Citrix and we thank you for your support and commitment in sharing our vision for the future of server-based computing. We??re proud of the great performances turned in by our employees, OEMs, resellers and industry alliances.  We enjoyed growth in every area in 1998, and our financial results show it. Net revenue increased by 101% over 1997 to $248.6 million. Aggressive global expansion led to a 204% growth in international business over 1997. Profitability was also solid with a growth of 76% in earnings per share to $0.94 excluding write-offs from acquisitions and amortization of intangibles. The year ended with a stronger-than-ever balance sheet that gives us the financial foundation we need to continue expanding the market for our enterprise and software products. 
 We believe that server-based computing is one of the largest and most dynamic new technology markets in evolution today. In fact, we estimate that in 1998 the server-based computing market grew to over one billion dollars for hardware, software and services twofold growth over 1997. We saw evidence of this market growth last September when we hosted Thinergy, the first conference for server-based computing. This event captured the hearts and minds of more than 2,000 customers, resellers and alliance members, and further demonstrated our leadership role in the evolving server-based computing market. 
 To capitalize on the potential of this market opportunity, we expanded our entire business infrastructure and opened new development facilities in Redmond and Salt Lake City. We also opened new operations in London, Cambridge, Munich, Paris and Tokyo increasing our workforce to more than 600 professionals worldwide. 
 New products, more alliances and a larger worldwide sales channel, fueled our growth in 1998. We introduced new server-based computing software, MetaFrame??, which was heralded with critical acclaim and quickly became our flagship product. We also forged expanded relationships with some of the most prestigious organizations in the world, including KPMG, Andersen Consulting, MCI Worldcom, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte & Touche, IBM Global Services and Siemens AG. In addition, our award-winning Citrix Solutions Network reseller program grew to a global force of more than 4,500 certified systems integrators. 
 In 1998, we acquired new technologies and talent to help create powerful enhancements to our existing products and exciting new products that will bring video and Java?? application capabilities to our system. These acquisitions will be essential to continuing our value-added product plans for the Windows NT?? Server operating system. And through our alliance with Microsoft, Windows?? 2000 will present Citrix with new opportunities to provide more enhanced server-based computing solutions. 
 We continued to garner very positive feedback from customers, resellers, industry alliances and investors throughout the year, and were proud recipients of many awards acknowledging our company performance, product vision and alliance programs. We were especially honored when we were added to the NASDAQ 100 and S&P 400 indices during 1998. 
 Our customers were also big winners in 1998. They leveraged more value from their existing computing infrastructures and rolled out new applications and software updates in record times. Our commitment to our customers is simple: We will build the software they need to deploy, access and manage applications in any computing environment. 
 Citrix had a great year in 1998, and we??re well-positioned to have an even stronger 1999. Thank you for working with us as an integral part of the Citrix family. 
"
Doc21,Citrix ,1999,"It all began with an idea: the idea that hosting and managing applications on a server would enable exciting new possibilities for information access. lt??s a deceptively simple notion, but a truly profound one that forms the basis for an easier, faster and broader world of computing a world where you can easily access any application with any dance, over any network. lt??s a world that requires digital independence to make accessing information and interacting with applications as easy as making a phone call.  While Citrix has certainly evolved over the course of our first decade, we are still as committed to that original idea as ever as we look to extend our position as a world leader in application serving. 
 We believe the application serving marker we pioneered is one of the most exciting and promising markets in all of information technology, Of everyone on this planet, more than two and a half billion people have yet to ??get connected-  through the Internet or otherwise- and become part of the information society. Application serving has the potential to change that. The need for quick and easy access to everything computing can offer is driving demand for a new form of global democracy: ??information citirenship for all. As people become more mobile and increasingly savvy about communicating in new ways with cell phones, palmtops and other wireless devices, traditional thinking about ??computing?? is giving way to new visions of information access at work, at home and at play. Application serving will make these visions real 
 All of this is good news for Citrix, as we are at the nerve center of these new information paradigms that will dominate the new millennium. The Citrix brand has long stood for application serving, and we boast the most impressive array of customers in the application-serving space all 100 of the Fortune 100. 
 Our aim is to offer the broadest set of products for providing access to any application in the world-from Windows?? to UNIX?? to java?? and Web application- so customers can implement their e-business systems at digital speed. 
 To a large extent, meeting customer needs in these evolutionary times means enhancing our already established position as a key infrastructure provider for application service providers, or ASPS. We are focused on delivering our ASP and other customers connect and compute application access through a Web browser, and we recently took our first strides in this direction with our new Citrix NFuse??' application portal product. Some of our most exciting new product efforts are targeted at extending our powerful application server solutions beyond our existing Windows, UNIX, java and video application offerings to Web-based applications, which we intend to make as rich in functionality and interactivity as traditional PC-based applications. We are also developing a robust set of value-added management tools that will allow our customers to provide superior application service levels to their subscribers. And as a framework for these product offerings, we are working in concert with our system integration partners to provide best-practices consulting services, education and technical support that is resulting in new levels of customer excellence 
 The timing is perfect for Citrix to extend our well-established position in the application-serving market, and we are moving aggressively to invest more rapidly in the business. The e-business worlds of Web commerce and ASPs are exploding, and we are moving at digital speed to become a strategic vendor in these markers. We are leveraging our strong balance sheet and healthy financial standing to open up new markets for our solutions and new products for our customers. We are aggressively growing our employee capabilities, infrastructure systems and operating practices to effectively meet out potential. 
 All of this promising future is a natural outgrowth from the great year we had in 1999. revenue was up 62 percent over 1998, and net income increased to 140 million or 1.35 per share. but excellent financial performance tells only a part of the Citrix story. We introduced Citrix MetaFrame and our first server-level management products in 1999, and we acquired ViewSoft to integrate important Web application serving technology into our product line. And during 1999 we exapnded our global geographic footprint established our role in the emerging ASP market through our business initiatives and launched our digital independence branding. 
 the best thing about our recent accomplishments is that they are only a beginning. As we continue to build upon that simple, but visionary idea from more than a decade ago, we are excited by the possibilities of new technologies, new products and new markets for application serving infrastructure. we thank all of our dedicated investors, customers and employees for joining us on this fantastic voyage. and we invite you to continue with us as we forge aggressively into our second decade. 
"
Doc22,Citrix ,2000,"Fiscal 2000 was clearly a year of challenge and change for both Citrix and the technology market. Throughout this dynamic year we stayed the course by delivering world-class application serving solutions that met our customers?? needs to simplify the complexity and reduce the cost of deploying and managing information.  Customer response to our products and services continued to prove the value of Citrix offerings during 2000, as we increased net revenue more than $67 million for the year.While we did not make the growth progress we had hoped for,we believe we made a strong showing in 2000 and are well positioned to make positive strides in 2001. 
 There were many important milestones in 2000 that we believe position us for success in the future: 
 Delivery of the first Citrix?? MetaFrame?? feature release along with an enhanced version of our Citrix NFuse??, application portal software. 
 Delivery of a new product, Citrix Extranet??, designed to meet the all-important need for secure application access over public networks such as the Internet. 
 Extension of the Citrix MetaFrame family to three UNIX?? platforms: Sun?? Solaris??, IBM?? AIX?? and HP-UX??. 
 A release of Citrix MetaFrame that enabled early adopters of the Microsoft??Windows?? 2000 platform to continue receiving the additional value and benefits of Citrix application serving and management software capabilities. 
 The year also included significant business expansion and development: 
 We acquired the Innovex Group, Inc., which forms the core of Citrix Consulting Services (CCS). CCS augments our ability to effectively meet customer needs for fully integrated application serving solutions, in addition to application serving products. 
 We continued to build our overall global presence with expansion efforts in a variety of regions such as Hong Kong, India and Latin America. 
 We added more top professionals to the ranks of Citrix including a new CIO bringing the employee total at year??s end to 1,398. 
 The year was further highlighted by major successes with customers and partners: 
 We surpassed 24 million end users of our Independent Computing Architecture (ICA??) technology. 
 We announced ASP (application service provider) partnership agreements with IBM and BT (British Telecom). 
 We announced Web Enterprise Information Portal (EIP) licensing agreements with both Yahoo! and mySAP.com??, followed later by similar announcements with a virtual ??Who??s Who?? in the EIP world Brio, Epicentric, Plumtree, Sequoia, Top Tier and Viador. 
 We signed a major systems integrator agreement with Compaq to sell Citrix software on its servers and provide professional services support. 
 We successfully demonstrated our Project Vertigo technology with several of our major partners, including Microsoft. 
 In all, we believe these highlights from 2000 demonstrate how we continued to grow our product lines, to expand our geographic reach, to build stronger business relationships with key industry players and to develop a Web strategy that positions us well as that market space matures and grows. 
 As we enter into FY2001, Citrix continues to be a global leader in application serving. We are building on the successes established during our first decade with a focus on: 
 Growing our ability to better meet customer needs by developing new channels, new partners and broader capabilities that will enable us to play a deeper and more significant role in our customers?? businesses. 
 Providing new product offerings, world-class service and support, and innovative licensing programs that help us continue meeting the needs of an increasing number of large-customer accounts. 
 Evolving our role in Web-based computing using the enterprise application portal as the foundation for delivering additional customer value in the e-business market. 
 Earlier this year, we launched our Citrix MetaFrame XP?? family of products the most sophisticated and important product family in Citrix history. Citrix MetaFrame XP is an extended platform release of the award-winning flagship product we first introduced in 1998. This newest edition of the Citrix MetaFrame family makes it simpler for customers to buy and implement Citrix solutions, enabling them to improve their business results with an increased number of more powerful application serving solutions. As we move through 2001, we believe the new Citrix MetaFrame XP family will be the backbone of our product family as we: 
 Support the ramped up implementation of Windows 2000. Broaden and deepen the value Citrix and our channel provide customers. Increase our ability to enhance application delivery and access over the Web. 
 Launching an exciting and important product like Citrix MetaFrame XP at the outset of 2001 was the perfect way to begin an exciting and important year for Citrix. The Citrix MetaFrame XP product family is a foundation for the total solution platform we deliver our customers, enabling IT professionals to cost-effectively make the digital workplace available for users any time, everywhere. 
 We continue to believe that our goal of extending the virtual workplace, everywhere, is the right approach for growth and continued improvement beyond 2000. Throughout the ups and downs, peaks and valleys of our journey, we are sincerely grateful for our dedicated and supportive shareholders. We look forward to more success on this journey, and we hope you will continue to remain part of the Citrix family. 
"
Doc23,Citrix ,2001,"I??ve never been more proud of Citrix than I am today. IT spending may have been down worldwide during 2001. The economy may have struggled. But there??s only one way to describe our performance for the year: ??Rock Solid.??  Citrix made great strides in 2001 toward accomplishing our vision of making the virtual workplace real. Companies looking for a better way to conduct business are increasingly turning to Citrix solutions. Our strong results for 2001 show it. In the year just completed, we experienced revenue growth of more than 25 percent despite a worldwide economic downturn. These gains are the result of hard work which penetrated more accounts and signed larger deals, expanded services such as our eLicensing program, and product innovation such as the phenomenally successful launch of Citrix MetaFrame XP. We invested in our future with the acquisition of Sequoia Software, the introduction of a new account management program and the expansion of our partner program. 
 In 2001, we grew both our core business and expanded our product line. We began our effort to establish ourselves as a leader in the access portal market. In 2001 we broadened beyond technology solutions to offer business solutions to customers as part of our strategy to more deeply penetrate the customer base and add more value to their businesses. In all our efforts, we built upon what we do best giving customers the ability to access any application and information from any device over any network. 
 The journey that Citrix began in 2001 positions us right where we need to be in 2002 and beyond. We are well situated to give our customers flexible, manageable Windows and Web-based solutions to real-world challenges. And we are in the right spot to achieve our business goals for 2002 of further enabling the virtual workplace market and owning the leadership position in the access portal category. 
 For 2002, we look forward to several new initiatives including providing more solutions to installed-base customers, establishing our new Citrix NFuse Elite access portal product in the marketplace and focusing on specific market opportunities that will help us to grow our business. 
 I want to thank all the people who helped us achieve the strong financial footing and industry-leading position we enjoy today; everyone from the investment community to our customers, business partners and employees. I invite all of you to stay with us as we move ahead. The vision is clear. The opportunities are waiting. At Citrix, we can??t wait to take advantage of them as we continue to make the virtual workplace real.

Doc24,Citrix ,2002,"Every company has a story.  More than just a sequence of events, it is a set of choices and responses, of actions and reactions, that reveals who a company is, what it stands for, and how it is likely to fare in the future. 
 The story of Citrix Systems began in 1989, when the company was founded with the vision of simplifying information access. We could call this start-up period our ??Surviving?? phase. Slowly, with determination and six years of hard work, Citrix grew to 80 employees and $14.6 million in revenues. 
 Phase 2 of the Citrix story began with our IPO in December 1995   the ??Thriving?? phase. One of Fortune??s ??100 Fastest-Growing Companies,?? our revenue increased by more than an order of magnitude in the next six years, reaching $591.6 million in 2001. That put us in the top 10% by revenue of all independent software vendors. We were a market leader in server-based computing, with market share of 76.8%, according to market research firm IDC. Around the world, approximately 35 million people were relying on Citrix for anytime, anywhere, any-device, any-connection access to the on-demand enterprise. 
 Then came 2002   an extremely difficult year for IT spending. 
 Last year was our most challenging year since we went public in 1995. The first two quarters were especially tough. Clearly, we had entered a new phase in our company story. It was time to regroup. 
 We assessed our business: A grand-slam product   Citrix?? MetaFrame XPTM, the most widely deployed presentation server in the world. A channel network with thousands of global resellers, distributors, system integrators and other partners in more than 100 countries, which had proven extremely effective in driving broad adoption of Citrix technology. In fact, nearly 50 million people in more than 120,000 organizations globally use Citrix today. And these customers, based on our ??world-class?? loyalty rating of 94%, are very loyal indeed. 
 With a limited product line and a single go-to-market strategy, we had achieved an extremely high customer presence, but had a long way to go in terms of our penetration of these organizations. Herein lies the opportunity. 
 We??ve seen the ??Surviving?? and the ??Thriving?? phases   now we??re in the ??Driving?? phase. At mid-year, we took decisive actions to drive MetaFrame standardization in our customer base. 
 Our new product strategy is to consolidate access infrastructure, historically fragmented into ??piece parts?? provided by multiple vendors, into one comprehensive solution. The Citrix?? MetaFrame?? Access Suite is an integrated access infrastructure solution that extends the core MetaFrame capabilities across an expanding array of enterprise access requirements, including presentation and application conferencing, device and network services, aggregation and personalization, and security and identity management. 
 It was just as important for us to diversify our go-to-market approaches as it was our product set. We added a second sales model to our channel: a new ??high customer-touch?? Enterprise Relationship Manager (ERM) program designed to drive deeper relationships with our key customers. 
 We launched these changes in mid-2002, and in the third quarter returned to revenue growth quarter-over-quarter. In the fourth quarter we saw an even stronger gain in revenues, achieving one of our best quarters ever. But this is the really important part: Six of our top ten fourth-quarter deals were re-orders, and eight of these top ten deals were greater than $500,000, including three over $1 million. Looking at the entire year, the number of deals greater than $500,000 in 2002 increased by 26% over 2001. We believe that our customer relationships are starting to drive MetaFrame standardization. 
 Our market opportunity is large, and growing. An increasingly mobile, global workforce needs access to the on-demand enterprise to make informed business decisions faster, be more productive, and provide better customer service from anywhere in the world. And companies need simpler and more costeffective ways to consolidate and manage enterprise IT resources. The intersection of these two intensifying market needs is our sweet spot. 
 We think we have a great story   for our shareholders, our employees, our business partners, and most of all for our customers. Though it??s still early, this story has already revealed much about who we are, what we stand for, and where we??re going. We are the global leader in enterprise access infrastructure. We stand for enabling anytime, anywhere, any-device, any-connection access to the on-demand enterprise. And as for where we??re going   our goal is to surpass $1 billion, and we believe that will be only the beginning.

Doc25,Citrix ,2003,"accessing information is central to all we do - as individuals, as organizations, as businesses. a doctor who can access accurate patient information from anywhere at anytime can provide better health care. a company that rapidly plugs new branch offices into its information lifeline can more quickly transform them from cost centers into revenue engines. the more you look at the basic activities of life, and the businesses and industries that are built around them, the more clear it becomes. people depend on access for everything they do.  and citrix, the only enterprise software company that is 100% focused on access, is well positioned to meet this universal need. 
 in our 2002 annual report, i discussed our goal of achieving and sustaining a billion dollars in annual revenue by focusing on access and driving the standardization of citrix access infrastructure as a strategic advantage in business. 
 we made excellent progress in 2003 - a great year for citrix, strategically, financially, and operationally. 
 revenues were 589 million, up 12% over our 2002 performance of 527 million. in fact, excluding royalties, 2003 was a record year for citrix revenue. it was also a record year for bookings, driven by solid software license sales and renewals of subscription advantage, our software license update program. annual net income for 2003 was 126.9 million or 0.74 per diluted share, as compared to net income for 2002 of 93.9 million or 0.52 per diluted share. and operating margins were solid at 26%, up from 20% in 2002. 
 our 2003 performance is the result of long-term strategic planning and reflects the larger market of acccess infrastructure that our new suite of products addresses. it was also a year of exceptional execution - especially in our product, partner, and go-to-market development. 2003 was, in fact, a transformational year in positioning citrix to achieve our goals for growth. 
 in february, we began repositioning citrix from the server-based computing market into the much larger access infrastructure market - which we estimate will grow to 8-10 billion over the next three to four years. 
 in march, we announced the citrix metaframe access suite, the most comprehensive access infrastructure solution for accessing any enterprise information resource. by september, we'd shipped upgrades to citrix metaframe presentation server for windows and unix, and three new products, secure access manager, conferencing manager, and password manager. the citrix metaframe access suite had gone from strategy to reality. 
 at our october customer conference, citrix iforum 2003, we made it easy to buy the suite, with three bundled pricing options - the suite edition for new customers, the step-up edition for existing customers, and the migration edition for metaframe 1.8 customers. 
 late in q3, we launched our first-ever, multi-million dollar worldwide advertising campaign featuring customers describing how citrix software is helping them grow and improve their business. the multi-faceted campaign, which will continue through 2004, features the cios of such companies as delta air lines, autonation and sumitomo corporation going on record to explain the value of their investment in citrix and the benefits it is yielding for their business. 
 going forward, we are elevating everything - our focus on access, our market, our products, our customer relationships, our brand, our partners, our employees and our business systems. and to drive the standardization of citrix access infrastructure, we are also elevating access from a tactical component of it to a strategic element of every business. 
 every business initiative - from m&a to business continuity from partner commerce to branch office expansion, from centralizing it to regulatory compliance - has an information access component that is critical to its succcess. it is the job of cios to support these initiatives by ensuring that employees, customers, and partners have on-demand access to the information they need. 
 yet, most businesses will employ if-then access tactics when connecting employees demanding information with applications supplying information. if you're at headquarters, for example, then access to an application works one way. if you're at a branch office, the same application is accessed another way. if you're a company's business partner, that application is accessed yet a different way. and so on. these multiplying if-then tactics add greater complexity, more cost and additional rigidity to an already complex and costly it environment. 
 citrix is a unique position to solve these problems by enabling our customers to create a single, well-conceived holistic strategy for providing secure, easy and instant access - eliminating the if-then approach. our customers are able to provide on-demand access to any application or information, no matter where it lives for anyone from virtually anywhere, anytime, using any device, over any connection. 
 our focus on access was the rationale for our december agreement to acquire expertcity, a market leader in web-based desktop access services. with the completion of the acquisition at the end of february 2004, expertcity is not the citrix online division, with gotomypc and gotoassist extending citrix access to applications and information that live on the desktop pc. now, whether your applications are hosted on the server, the desktop, or both, you can access them with citrix software. 
 we entered the year as the leader in server-based computing and exited the year as the leader in a much larger market, with multiple products in an integrated suite, and more products on the way to address the single, critical customer value that citrix stands for: access. 
 when i look ahead to the rest of 2004 and beyond, i get very excited at our prospects. i believe that we've laid the groundwork for growth in a large-scale, long-term infrastructure market.

Doc26,Compuware ,1996,"During fiscal 1996. Compuware continued to make great strides toward completing a transition that redefines our organization and strengthens our position for growth. Compuware is no longer mainframe-centric. We now move forward as a Company that offers solutions across mainframe and client/server technologies.  The latter phases of this transition include initiatives to prepare Compuware for additional growth as well. To this end, a model for global decentralized operations is now in place. Named Compuware 2000, it has become our model for future organizational design. By partitioning the activities of development laboratories, country sales offices and professional services branch offices, the Company believes it is better positioned to manage growth efficiently. The respective core areas of product development and marketing. strategic and tactical sales and the deployment of professional services on a global scale can be kept in sharperfocus as we progress. 
 Revenues for the fiscal year ending March 31 1996, were $614 million, up 15.1% from the prior year. Before special charges, net income for the fiscal year was $763 million and earnings per share were $1.70. 
 Software license fee revenue increased 1.4% during fiscal 1996, growing from $223.6 million to $226.7 million. Maintenance revenue grew 19.6% from $153.8 million to $184.0 million, and professional services fees increased 30.1% from $156.5 million to $203.6 million. 
 A Commitment to Solutions during fiscal 1996, Compuware launched a project that underscores the unique synergy of Compuware's products and services divisions. production 2000, a century date-change solution for clients, combines a definitive project methodology with specific date-change related techniques for deploying Compuware testing, debugging and quality assurance tools. Production 2000 engagements are now underway and more are scheduled. 
 Our application development environment, UNIFACE, now has over 3,000 customers worldwide, and has grown to be our third largest selling product. Taken in combination, the UNIFACE product, our growing professional services capabilities, our expanding set of testing and debugging tools for client/server, and our successful offerings in client/server application management offer our clients and prospects a solution set that is an industry benchmark. Our foundation for growth has never been stronger. 
 I wish to thank Compuware shareholders customers and partners. In addition, please join me in recognizing the outstanding contributions of our management team and of each and every Compuware employee.

Doc27,Compuware ,1997,"Fiscal 1997 was a year of significant accomplishment for Compuware Corporation. Our end-of-year results confirm that the course we are following is a sound one, and I am pleased to report that we are well positioned to continue executing our strategy in the current fiscal year. The Company is now in its 25th year of operation, and has changed to the extent that our client/server offerings are fast becoming the drive behind our present growth. This is truly a milestone that follows noteworthy developments throughout the range of our product and services offerings.  In fiscal 1997, we experienced renewed momentum in UNIFACE sales, an expanded pipeline for Eco5COPE sales, and a warm reception by industry analysts for our new QACenter client/server testing tools. In addition, new license sales of our mainframe products continue to be exceptionally strong. We recognize that mainframe technology continues to have a role in business-critical applications. Today, mainframe computing represents a standard for stability and power, and for client/server deployments, a means of functioning as a very large server. Our Professional Services Division also grew during this pastfiscal year. Services growth was fueled in part by greater demand among our clients for stand-alone client/server professional services and for value-added services related to UNIFACE. 
 Revenues for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1997 were $812.9 million, up 32.3% from the prior year. Before special charges, net income for the fiscal year was $113.7 million and earnings per share were $2.53 (pre-split) and $1.26 (post-split). 
 software license fee revenue increased 40. 7% during fiscal 1997, growing from $226. 7 million to $318.9 million. Maintenance revenue grew 13.8%from $184.0 million to $209.5 million, and professional services fees increased 39. 7% from $203.6 million to $284.5 million. 
 The course followed in fiscal 1997 enabled the Company to further unfold a strategy that was first detailed almost three years ago. Compuware's mission then was to move from being a predominately mainframe-driven organization to one that could jointly serve the established mainframe and emerging clien/server marketplaces. This meant planning for new products and services, and expanding our business alliance partnerships. Our focus on end-to-end application stability also helped to guide our progress. For that reason, the scope of the Compuware built-test-manage product offerings has become unique in our industry. The value of our mainframe testing and implementation products continues to be underscored by customers who ask us to participate in their comprehensive enterprise-wide initiatives. And today, the migration of testing and implementation products from their mainframe beginnings to client/server platforms is a reality. In turn, our professional services business now reaches across all of our client/server product offerings. 
 Our strategy also called for the building of an organization that could sustain future growth. Going forward as?? a global decentralized organization, the Company benefits from the Compuware 2000 model of organizational design which was unveiled last year. Cornpuware 2000 will continue to help with the efficient management of growth. 
 I wish to thank Compuware shareholders, customers, partners and employees for a year that enables us to look ahead with enthusiasm.

Doc28,Compuware ,1998,"Fiscal 1998 was an outstanding year for Compuware Corporation, distinguished by significant growth in revenue and profitability. Our success in reaching the $1 billion revenue milestone further validates our strategy of providing practical solutions to our clients and ensuring that Compuware is recognized as a leading information technology provider by every Chief Information Officer. As we continue to execute this strategy during the current fiscal year, I remain optimistic about our opportunities for future success.  In fiscal 1998, we achieved excellent growth in our client/server offerings, which we continued to improve through strategic acquisitions and business alliances with key information technology vendors. New license sales of mainframe products remained strong, confirming the size of this market and the effectiveness of our expanding worldwide distribution capability. Our UNIFACE product line achieved positive momentum, solidifying its reputation as the gold standard in component-based development tools. We also implemented an increasing number of ??end-to-end?? solutions for our clients, which seamlessly integrate Compuware consultants, products and professional services to solve difficult business problems. Well-received by our clients and industry analysts, we expect these integrated solutions to expand our presence and enhance our competitiveness. 
 Fiscal 1998 also marked the launch of a comprehensive brand advertising campaign that positioned Compuware as the leading provider of ??People and Software for Business Applications.?? The considerable name recognition this campaign continues to generate from the tagline ??What Do You Need Most??? is building solid brand awareness and increasing the visibility of Compuware with large clients. 
 Standing behind our accomplishments this fiscal year was an experienced executive management staff and a team of dedicated employees, who made the success of our company their first priority. 
 Revenues for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1998 were $1.139 billion, up 40.2% from the prior year. Before special charges, net income for the fiscal year was $198.5 million and earnings per share were $1.13 (basic EPS) and $1.02 (diluted EPS). 
 Software license fee revenue increased 46.5% during fiscal 1998, growing from $318.9 million to $467.3 million. Maintenance revenue grew 16.6% from $209.5 million to $244.3 million and professional services fees increased 50.4% from $284.5 million to $427.8 million. 
 SEVEN REASONS FOR GROWTH We believe there are seven fundamental reasons why Compuware can expect to succeed and prosper going forward. I??d like to share those with you: Information technologies are additive. Rather than replacing old technology, new uses are found for new technology. Compuware has built and is successfully managing a worldwide distribution capability for its products and services. Our mainframe technology readily transfers to other platforms. Client/server products scale down, opening up new, broader markets. Within our worldwide customer base, many opportunities for large deals remain. The worldwide market for our professional services is huge and growing. UNIFACE is superbly wellpositioned within its market segment. 
 I wish to thank Compuware shareholders, clients and partners. In addition, please join me in recognizing the outstanding contributions of our management team and employees. 
"
Doc29,Compuware ,1999,"Fiscal 1999 was another year of outstanding growth in revenue and profitability for Compuware Corporation. During the year, we reached more than $1.6 billion in revenue and earned wide recognition from many of the world??s largest 20,000 corporations for the value we bring to their businesses. Our strategy of providing practical solutions that deliver immediate and measurable return on our clients?? Information Technology (IT) investments continued to be a successful one, validated by double-digit growth in all business lines. As we continue to execute this strategy during the current fiscal year, I remain confident of our opportunities for continued growth and see no significant impediments to achieving our aggressive goals.  Compuware??s strong fiscal year results reflect the value our clients continue to find in the products and professional services we offer. During fiscal 1999, we enhanced this value by introducing new versions of our products, extending product support and integration, acquiring new technology, entering into key productivity partnerships and expanding our professional services staff. These activities enabled us to achieve excellent growth in our mainframe and client/server product lines and to further integrate Compuware people, products and professional services into valuable solutions for our clients. 
 Supporting e-commerce and web-based systems was a critical part of our strategy during fiscal 1999. Today, e-commerce, or web-based systems development and deployment, represents more that 12 percent of our license and services revenue. We expect this new technology to continue to add to our strength, contribute to our revenue and provide us with yet another engine for growth. 
 Another important development this fiscal year was the tremendous number of companies that re-legitimized their mainframe environments by spending millions of dollars to make them Year 2000 (Y2K) compliant, thereby committing themselves to that resource for the foreseeable future. Our experience shows us that if a company wants efficient, secure, rapid-response, high-transaction Internet applications, they have almost exclusively picked a mainframe as their server. Given Compuware??s role as the preeminent supplier of mainframe productivity tools, we fully expect these companies to look to Compuware for their productivity solutions. 
 Revenues for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1999 were $1.638 billion, up 43.8 percent from the prior year. Before special charges, net income for the fiscal year was $352.7 million and earnings per share were 96 cents (basic EPS) and 88 cents (diluted EPS). 
 Software license fee revenue increased 46.2 percent during fiscal 1999, growing from $467.3 million to $683.4 million. Maintenance revenue grew 36.9 percent from $244.3 million to $334.4 million and professional services fees increased 45.1 percent from $427.8 million to $620.7 million. 
 Why Compuware Will Continue to Create Value Here are a few reasons why Compuware will continue to create value for our clients: Compuware products offer our clients tremendous value in short time frames. Our products have long, useful lives. They are constantly updated to reflect new and changing technology. Compuware products improve the productivity of our clients?? employees, not their infrastructure. Consequently, we are not susceptible to the cyclical nature of MIP shipments. Our products provide the same compelling productivity and value proposition when used in new development, maintenance or package installs. They are particularly useful for e-commerce and web-based applications. 
 Having just completed a year in which we smashed every expectation by a wide margin, we now have an exciting opportunity to duplicate this difficult feat during the current fiscal year. 
 I firmly believe that our strategies, practices and people will continue to create value for clients and show you why Compuware is one of the best high-tech companies in the world. 
"
Doc30,Compuware ,2000,"This was a remarkable year for Compuware Corporation. It was both extremely exciting and very challenging.  This past year the company grew more than 36 percent, reaching over $2.2 billion in revenues. Through acquisitions and internal growth we added almost 5,000 information technology (IT) professionals to our staff, increasing our ranks to nearly 16,000 full-time employees. Our profit margins continued to be among the highest in the industry, although our stock price slumped due to the fact that we missed our analysts?? expectations. 
 Many IT companies experienced difficulty on Wall Street in the past year, particularly those firms whose profits were exceeded by their marketing hype. During this time period, we concentrated on growing and maintaining a solid, healthy business that will continue to perform consistently over time. Our perspective was, is and will be a long-term perspective. We are continuing to work very hard to make sure our investors receive the returns they have come to expect from Compuware. 
 Fiscal year 2000 was very similar to fiscal year 1995, a year in which we experienced excellent growth and profitability, yet suffered from a declining stock price. I compare the two years for one simple reason: we have the opportunity once again to grow the value of Compuware significantly. 
 Compuware has continued to grow and prosper for more than 27 years because we are a strong and resilient business that delivers real value to its customers. Our products and professional services are not tied to the latest technology and are therefore not vulnerable to constantly shifting technological trends. Delivering value to customers never goes out of style. 
 We focus on what works and on what our customers tell us they need most. And that??s why our clients keep coming back. They know we can help them use technology to solve business problems, and that we can help them improve the efficiency and productivity of their businesses. In good times or bad, Compuware solutions are always in demand. 
 Important developments that occurred during fiscal year 2000: Large Contracts During fiscal year 2000, Compuware and its health care affiliate, CareTech Solutions, Inc., announced a 10-year, $1 billion agreement with The Detroit Medical Center (DMC) for the outsourcing of DMC??s Information Systems Division. The initial 10-year outsourcing agreement provided for two, two-year extensions. The agreement is one of the largest health care outsourcing contracts of its kind. 
 Professional Resources Compuware acquired Data Processing Resources Corporation (DPRC) during fiscal year 2000 through a cash tender offer. DPRC was a leading national professional services company that focused on the IT sector and provided professional services to a diverse group of Fortune 1000 clients worldwide. Approximately 3,400 DPRC technical professionals joined Compuware??s Professional Services Division as a result of the acquisition. The addition of these technicians enabled us to deliver professional services solutions to 27 new cities in the western, southwestern and southeastern United States. 
 E-Commerce Supporting Internet, e-commerce and web-based systems continued to be an important part of our strategy during fiscal year 2000. Demand was strong for our suite of products and professional services for the complete e-commerce life cycle, from initial strategy through the ongoing development, testing, marketing and managing of web sites. 
 Compuware established its first two Digital Development Centers during fiscal year 2000. Located in Kansas City, Missouri and Farmington Hills, Michigan, these centers provide our customers with a complete range of e-commerce services from web site strategy, conceptualization, creation and performance management to back-office architecture, legacy integration and load testing. 
 For all the excitement and challenge e-commerce can generate, the reality is that the technology is still based on a software application. Compuware has specialized in providing services and tools that focus on software applications  and how to optimize their business value since our inception. As long as our customers continue to derive value from this newest wave of technology, Compuware will be there to support them. 
 Business Alliances Compuware??s Corporate Alliances Division provides technology, education, technical support and cooperative marketing efforts to ensure that Compuware solutions support each environment. Tier-one partners with whom we established or strengthened alliances during the fiscal year include IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Siebel Systems, SAP, PeopleSoft and Compaq. We continued focusing our alliance efforts on the e-commerce and enterprise application markets during the year, where Compuware is committed to providing integrated products and professional services that deliver solutions clients need. 
 Investor Communications Underscoring our commitment to continually enhancing communications with our investors, we introduced a new investor relations web site and phone system this fiscal year. Compuware??s new web site, located at www.compuware.com, includes features and information such as interactive stock charts, historical price lookup, calendar of events, financial reports and releases and the latest SEC filings and investor presentations. Also included are frequently asked questions, executive biographies, mergers and acquisitions and information request forms. In addition, investors can use our web site to sign up for e-mail alerts that will notify them when new content is added to the site, as well as register to hear live webcasts of company quarterly earnings conference calls. 
 Compuware??s new investor relations toll-free phone line (1-877-779-CPWR) allows investors to listen to the latest financial release, summaries of the latest company news releases and the most frequently asked questions. Investors can also request investor kits, press releases by fax and to talk directly with an investor relations representative. 
 New Headquarters To support our growing workforce, Compuware and the City of Detroit announced an agreement to move Compuware??s corporate headquarters to downtown Detroit. Our new headquarters will anchor Detroit??s Campus Martius development in the heart of Detroit??s central business district. Our one million square foot facility is scheduled to be completed in 2002. 
 Fiscal 2000 Results Revenues for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2000 were $2.231 billion, up 36.1 percent from the prior year. Before special charges and amortization expense, income from operations increased 17.9 percent to $602.1 million from $510.6 million. Including special charges and amortization expense, income from operations during the fiscal year increased 10.1 percent to $551.3 million from $500.6 million. 
 Before special charges and amortization expense during fiscal year 2000, net income increased 9.8 percent to $392.2 million from $357.3 million. Including special charges and amortization expense, net income increased 0.6 percent to $352.0 million from $349.9 million in the previous fiscal year. 
 Earnings per share before special charges and amortization expense (diluted computation) increased 14.6 percent to $1.02 from 89 cents, based upon 384.7 million and 402.0 million shares outstanding, respectively. Earnings per share including special charges and amortization expense (diluted computation) increased 4.6 percent to 91 cents from 87 cents. 
 During the year, software license fees increased 19.9 percent to $819.2 million from $683.4 million. Maintenance revenue grew 29.4 percent to $432.7 million from $334.4 million. Professional services fees increased 57.7 percent to $978.7 million from $620.7 million. 
 Looking Ahead Providing practical solutions that deliver immediate and measurable return on our customers?? IT investment is Compuware??s core business strategy. Here are the ways in which we expect to extend this strategy during fiscal year 2001: Transition our Professional Services Division to a business model that emphasizes sales as well as delivery Integrate product and professional services offerings more closely Maintain our competitive edge in the S/390 mainframe market Leverage our product strengths in the distributed systems market Align the organization to better support customers and facilitate teamwork 
 Since 1973, Compuware solutions have delivered productivity, quality, performance and adaptability. Regardless of the technology our clients choose to employ, they continue to choose Compuware to deliver the most precious commodity of all: value. 
 Thank you for your support of Compuware. We are working very hard to make sure you are rewarded for your confidence in our company. 
"
Doc31,Compuware ,2001,"What a year it has been. Stock valuations across industries and markets are uniformly down. Macroeconomic conditions have had a significant impact on the technology business. Many unprofitable dot-coms and their shaky business models have dried up and blown away.  Yet some companies, Compuware among them, remain profitable in this environment, because we offer compelling economic and technological value to our customers. At Compuware, this is a tribute to the loyal, talented and committed employees who dedicate themselves to our company, believe in our strategy and help make it a reality. 
 I would also like to thank our shareholders for their continued support of this company. Since our Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 1992, Compuware's market capitalization has increased approximately 400 percent. If you have held Compuware shares since our IPO, you have earned a return of more than 227 percent, based on April 24, 2001 data. You have also witnessed numerous other periods of spectacular growth, including a three-year period when our stock delivered an 872.8 percent total return. 
 I recognize this year has been an awful one for our shareholders and our business, but I believe Compuware has emerged stronger for it. Our company is more focused, more competitive and more responsive than we were when I last wrote you. We are aggressively monitoring our administrative costs and processes to ensure that our product developers and professional services staff are able to do what they do best: help our clients get more value from their computer systems. We will continue to use our administration and management teams to support our technical staff, allowing them the freedom to be innovative and successful. 
 Despite changing technologies and newly emerging challenges, the roots of our business philosophy remain simple: We help people do things with computers. Compuware upholds these principles because they work, proven by the success we've experienced through nearly 29 years in the technology business. The Compuware philosophy doesn't prevent us from pursuing opportunities that involve new technologies. Rather, our processes, our people and our software continue to help our customers wring the most value out of all of their technology. This means that Compuware is not dependent on the technology of the moment, because we deliver value that transcends technological trends. Compuware's roots are described in our mission statement and business objectives, and I refer to them often, because I know they are the reason for our past achievements and the basis of our future success. 
 Compuware's mission is to be the best worldwide provider of quality software products and professional services that increase productivity. We strive to meet the needs of our customers and exceed what they expect of us. Our continued success in accomplishing this mission enables us to reward our employees and shareholders. Our mission isn't complicated, but it's valuable. In times when everyone is watching the bottom line, few things are more valued than a trusted partner like Compuware, with our ability to help businesses save time and money. 
 We use our business objectives as a map to accomplish our mission. These objectives are based on healthy growth and controlled costs. Our objectives are also centered on meeting the needs of our customers and surpassing their expectations for service. In the coming year, we will continue to work hard to meet all of our business objectives so we can fulfill our mission and, ultimately, increase the size and value of our company. The entire executive leadership team at Compuware is committed to achieving our mission and moving the company forward in a steady, sustainable manner that will help Compuware grow while giving you our investors, a solid return. 
 The remainder of our 2001 Annual Report is focused on three topics: how we got to where we are today, how we plan to grow Compuware and why we expect to be successful. Before we examine these topics, let's review our plans and goals from last year. In our fiscal 2000 Annual Report, we described five objectives in our Looking Ahead section. Here are last year's goals and how we achieved them: 
 To transition our Professional Services Division (PSD) to a business model that emphasizes sales as well as delivery. We have spent the past year retooling our services division, Margins have improved significantly, from negative 8.4 percent at the close of the fiscal 2000 fourth quarter to positive 4.7 percent at the end of the fiscal 2001 fourth quarter. Our services organization, which is more focused and more competitive than it was a year ago, is now under the guidance of Senior Vice President Alan Cantrell. 
 We have implemented organizational changes in the services business, allowing our sales force to work more directly with our clients. These organizational changes have not only improved our client relationships, they have given our customers more opportunities to directly communicate their business needs to our services team. Unfortunately, services results throughout the year were hampered by our continuing integration of DPRC into Compuware and, to a lesser extent, the economic climate. We are addressing these problems and we expect to increase profits and head count in the coming year. 
 Integrate product and professional services offerings more closely. Our PointForward solution is an example of our successful efforts in this area. Recently cited by industry analysts as a visionary offering, PointForward combines the technical strength of our software with the experience of our services staff. PointForward is delivered to our clients over the Internet, giving them a rapid and flexible solution for monitoring the performance of web-based applications. We plan to make further strides integrating our products and services, and we will continue to use our integrated solutions to differentiate ourselves from our competition. 
 Maintain our competitive edge in the mainframe market. We continue to develop and improve upon our industry-leading mainframe products. These products have helped thousands of organizations across the world save time and money. Our mainframe products provide powerful analysis and testing functionality across multiple platforms and help mainframe programmers test more accurately and reliably and recover from errors more quickly. The strength of our mainframe product line is its compelling value proposition, and I believe this segment of our business will continue to demonstrate solid growth. 
 Leverage our competitive strengths in the distributed systems market. Compuware has more than 25,000 customers who use our software or services. These clients know and trust Compuware, giving us a competitive advantage in sales of new distributed products. We will continue to put that advantage to full use. Compuware will also continue to capitalize on our position as one of the most profitable, financially stable companies in the distributed software market. Our profitability and financial stability allow us to invest significant resources in improving and integrating our distributed product family. We have continually enhanced our distributed products over the past year, and these efforts are beginning to pay off. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, our new license revenue from distributed products showed a 27.2 percent rate of sequential growth. If this growth rate continues, we wouid see Compuware's distributed products revenue increase more than 150 percent over the next fiscal year. 
 Align the organization to better support customers and facilitate teamwork. A number of organizational changes took place in fiscal 2001 that will help us continue to meet this goal. Our executive team has been restructured, and I'm confident that we have chosen the right people for the challenges facing Compuware. We have also changed the structure of our products organization, from an organization based on individual product lines to an organization based on product functions. This new structure helps speed the integration of products with related functions and also helps get software to market more quickly. As I previously mentioned, we have also made significant changes to the structure of our services organization, allowing us to more efficiently and effectively serve our clients. 
 Our successful work toward these goals has provided Compuware with a solid foundation from which to grow in fiscal 2002. During the upcoming fiscal year, we expect to increase our earnings per share in the 40-to-50 percent range, fueled by an increasingly profitable professional services business and improved software sales. 
 I am energized and optimistic about fiscal year 2002. We are poised to achieve our goals, because our organization rests on a base of strong fundamentals and talented individuals. We are committed to delivering long-term value to our shareholders, our customers and our employees. We believe our strategy for the upcoming year will help us honor these commitments. Thank you for your investment in our company. 
"
Doc32,Compuware ,2002,"Fiscal 2002 was a difficult year for Compuware Corporation. While our stock price increased 32.4 percent for the fiscal year, we suffered a 14 percent reduction in revenues. Additionally, for the first time in our history, we made the painful decision to significantly reduce Compuware??s workforce. These reductions were implemented in areas where our staff was underutilized and our market share could not support business growth. In order to be a successful company, Compuware must grow, and grow profitably. This restructuring, though difficult, will improve Compuware??s profitability and better position the company for long-term growth benefiting our employees and shareholders.  The positive news is that Compuware remains profitable, and our fundamental financial position is very sound. We have outstanding cash flow, no long-term debt and more than $400 million in cash and cash equivalents. The restructuring announced at the beginning of fiscal 2003 should reduce our annual expenses by approximately $200 million and considerably improve our professional services margins. 
 These strong fundamentals mean that Compuware has a good base from which to build. Outstanding employees, excellent technology and the strength of our financial position will help ensure our growth and profitability. But growth and profitability aren??t enough. No one on our executive management team is content with Compuware being merely a good company. We want more than that and our employees and investors deserve it. But we must increase our revenues and earnings to achieve a better stock price. This is one of my chief responsibilities, and I take it very seriously. 
 However, increasing revenue growth for a billion-dollar-plus company is a much greater challenge than increasing growth for a smaller organization. This law of large numbers is compounded by the hangover currently affecting our industry. For too many years, companies have poured millions of dollars into packaged applications, dot-coms and overpriced consultants, only to find they needed to spend many times that amount to implement the technology. Decision-makers at these companies are not receiving the return they expect on investments of this magnitude, making them leery of technology investments altogether. Compuware has an advantage here. Our products and services demonstrate some of the most compelling return on investment of any in the industry. Nonetheless, this is the mindset we must overcome in an already difficult economic environment. 
 The issues we must address are not only external. In the late 1990s, it was much easier to make money as a technology company than it is today. The business walking in through the door took priority over addressing organizational inefficiencies. Today??s economic reality, however, means we must transform our business to succeed: not through a magic pill, or a marketing campaign, but through fundamental change and hard work. Companies the size of Compuware cannot change instantly. But we are committed to changing because we must to meet our goals. 
 Last year??s goals were: to maintain our competitive edge in the mainframe market, to expand our distributed systems market share and to grow our professional services business. How did we do  While the overall business is still profitable and healthy, our results in attaining these goals were largely unimpressive. 
 Our mainframe business continues to be strong. For the year, our mainframe products?? revenue was $687.3 million. Nearly 30 years in the mainframe products business give Compuware a profitable maintenance base, high margins and longstanding business relationships with Fortune 1,000 companies. Our mainframe business is a competitive advantage that none of our competitors in the distributed marketplace has, giving us significant cash flow for research and development. Since our mainframe business remains the bedrock upon which we will expand our already formidable family of distributed products, we are aggressively defending our mainframe revenue through continual development efforts. 
 As a percentage of software revenues, we did not significantly increase distributed systems products?? revenue during the fiscal year. Though these results were disappointing, our capacity for growth in this market is enormous, and increasing distributed systems revenue remains a key focus for the company. Compuware distributed products, like our mainframe tools, reduce our customers?? expenses, save their time and make their staff more productive. Compuware invests a significant percentage of our research and development (R&D) dollars in our distributed products an investment dwarfing the percentage of revenue and absolute dollars spent by our competitors in the distributed marketplace. Our R&D efforts are strengthening our awardwinning distributed product family, and over the next year we will work toward making every one of our distributed products a ??must have.?? 
 We were unable to significantly improve our margins or build the critical mass required for growth in our services business this fiscal year. These facts led us to restructure our professional services business beginning in April 2002. While this was a difficult decision, we believe the restructuring will allow Compuware to begin growing its professional services business profitably again. We intend to manage our off-assignment personnel and our hiring practices more effectively, preventing a recurrence of the problems that limited services revenue growth this year. Compuware remains committed to the services business. Our services personnel create new sales opportunities by representing our company to customers around the world, and they continue to provide us with timely, accurate intelligence on customer needs. 
 As we reviewed our goals from last year, and our plans for the next fiscal year, it became apparent that a fundamental change in the structure and operations of our entire company was necessary. We??re profitable and stable, but Compuware is not growing the way it must to be a successful company and a successful investment. To that end, we have implemented a new organizational structure, based on four cornerstones: One Company, Process Driven, Customer Facing and Employees = Assets. These cornerstones represent an essential change in the way Compuware conducts business every day. I believe in these cornerstones, and I believe in the people who are implementing them. Continue reading this report to learn more about our strategy for change and our plans for products and services in the coming year. These changes are essential and ongoing, and they are the keys to our success. 
 Thank you for investing in Compuware Corporation. I??m working very hard to make sure your faith in our company is rewarded. I look forward to reporting to you on our progress again next year. 
"
Doc33,Compuware ,2003,"Compuware remained profitable and debt-free during fiscal 2003, enhancing our ability to produce competitive offerings that deliver the productivity and value customers demand. In our 30th year of continuous operation, we have excellent cash flow, more than $500 million in cash and investments, and exciting new initiatives we believe will help us grow the company.  We achieved our financial status in spite of a sluggish economy, excess capacity and increased price pressure from competitors and customers. For the third consecutive year, spending on Information Technology (IT) was flat, making sales cycles longer and deals more difficult to complete. 
 While it is difficult to predict when market conditions will improve, we are confident the market is going to change before long, and we are well positioned to take advantage of any upturns. We are equally confident in the four strategic initiatives we??re launching in fiscal 2004. These initiatives complement and extend our existing products and services, helping customers quickly and reliably put business applications into action. Compuware??s four strategic initiatives for this fiscal year are the Compuware Application Reliability Solution (CARS), OptimalJ, Vantage and our NearShore Development Center. 
 CARS Software quality, reliability and time-to-market are some of the biggest challenges facing IT organizations today. CARS helps IT organizations meet these challenges through the use of highly skilled people, a solid testing methodology and industry-leading products. By linking development, quality assurance and operations, CARS is the only solution on the market that offers customers the people, processes and products necessary to ensure the quality and reliability of their most important business applications. 
 OptimalJ Developing enterprise applications using Java technologies is complex and difficult, slowing down advanced Java developers and causing difficulty for mainstream developers. OptimalJ is an advanced development environment that enables developers of all experience levels to rapidly design, develop and deploy reliable, industrial-strength enterprise applications. Increasing productivity by as much as 40 percent, OptimalJ generates complete, maintainable working applications directly from a visual model, using sophisticated patterns to implement accepted best practices for J2EE coding. 
 Vantage The primary measure of a Chief Information Officer??s success is the delivery of reliable, high-performing software applications that support the core business needs of the organization. The focus of Compuware??s Vantage suite is to provide unsurpassed visibility and control over software application deployment, monitoring and problem resolution in complex data processing environments. 
 NearShore Development Center More than ever before, companies today are initiating cost-saving efforts by outsourcing application development and maintenance to external service providers. Alongside our traditional services business which offers the services of skilled IT professionals at a reasonable cost we also offer customers our NearShore Development Center (NSDC) in Montreal. Compuware??s NSDC is a lowcost vehicle that delivers value to our North American customers who desire comprehensive outsourcing services for the support of their distributed, e-business or enterprise software. 
 We are currently engaged in substantial launch, marketing and public relations efforts that are focused specifically on these four key initiatives. Our ability to conduct these activities is supported by our almost 30-year affiliation with mainframe software the bedrock upon which our business was built. It has afforded us a substantial maintenance base, high profit margins, quality business prospects and longstanding relationships with practically all Fortune 1000 companies. Compuware mainframe software sales also give us a steady source for financing the research and development necessary to be successful in the distributed software sector. 
 Maintenance renewal rates for our mainframe products continued to be very high during fiscal 2003, solid evidence that our software continues to deliver value to customers every day. To further demonstrate the payback our mainframe applications provide over the competition, we??ve developed Return-On-Investment calculators for our mainframe products. These tools are already being used successfully by our sales force to demonstrate to customers the large cost savings our mainframe software products deliver. 
 I can assure you that our management team and employees are giving you their very best efforts toward meeting Compuware??s goals for the new fiscal year. As our shareholders, you deserve no less. 
"
Doc34,ea ,1996,"We achieved many of our goals for fiscal 1996, posting record revenues and emerging as a world leader in sales of interactive software for personal computers. We also added proven development talent to our worldwide creative team and expanded our international distribution infrastructure to new geographic territories. In just six months following the arrival of the PlayStation?? game console in the U.S. market, we generated more than 50 million in revenues on this important new platform.  Despite these successes, fiscal 1996 was a challenging year. The North American market accelerated its transition from Sega?? Genesis?? and Super NESW?? cartridge systems to the PlayStation, the Sega Saturn??. and multimedia PCs, and this substantially reduced revenues in an important segment of our business. We offset this anticipated decline by continuing to invest in new platforms such as PCs, the PlayStation, and the Sega Saturn, and in geographic diversification. Expansion of our distribution system overseas helped grow our international revenues by 43% to s226 million for the year. As a result, overall revenues grew 8% to a new high of :53: million. Net income of :40 million was lower than in fiscal 1995, due to increased costs and start-up delays associated with developing and manufacturing more technologically complex products for the new platforms. We believe we have identified the contributing factors, and have taken specific steps designed to improve development efficiency, schedule predictability and profitability in fiscal 1997. 
 RAPID INTERNATIONAL GROWTH Our fundamental strategy for becoming the world's leading interactive entertainment company is to create best-selling products ancl distribute them directly to retailers around the world. For the past 10 years we have steadily built an extensive network of subsidiaries and offices outside North America to localize our products and marketing, and to establish direct relationships with retailers. This strategy is most advanced in Europe, where we have implemented a pan-European distribution network that delivers almost 80% of our products directly to retailers. 
 During fiscal 1996 we successfully integrated last year's acquisitions of Kingsoft GMBH in Germany and DROsoFt in Spain. We also opened EA Nordic in Stockholm, Sweden to distribute EA titles in Sweden. Norway, Finland, Denmark, and Iceland. EA was the market share leader among interactive software publishers in the U.K. and Germany last year, and also published Europe's top-selling title for the year across all interactive platforms, FIFA Soccer 96. At the end of the fiscal year we released Wing Cmmnander The Price of Freedom for the PC to overwhelming response, particularly in Germany. 
 While we grow market share in North America, Europe, and Japan, we are also preparing to move aggressively into the world's  markets. During fiscal 1996 we opened new offices in Malaysia and Singapore, acquired a distributor in South Africa, and began the process of establishing a presence in the People's Republic of China. We have long distributed the Products of other interactive entertainment publishers through our Affiliated Label program. This year we added twentieth Century Fox Home: entertainment, Inc. as a partner, and began distributing Fox Interactive products in international markets. 
 EXPANDED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT Electronic Arts has built one of the industry??s strongest development organizations by hiring and acquiring world-class creative talent. During fiscal 1996 we added Manley 8c Associates of Seattle, washington creator of numerous popular products for EA and other leading publishers.We successfully integrated Bullfrog Productions Ltd., acquired in fiscal 1995, into our worldwide creative team. We also expanded the capacity of our ORIGIN Systems, Inc. studios by opening a new development office in Baltimore, Maryland EA??s worldwide product development community now numbers over 800 employees. 
 In the crowded interactive entertairunent market, strong brands stand out. While continuing to strengthen our core brands such as EA SPORTS, in fiscal 1996 we launched a high-profile new brand For our military and combat products: Jane??s Combat Simulations. Jane's informative Group has been the definitive source of information on military craft and equipment for over one hundred years. Through our exclusive agreement, EA products feature Jane??s All the World??s multimedia reference guide that includes published and unpublished data, images, and rate in-fiight video footage with each product. Our newly released advanced Tartical fight for example, is the only flight simulation that features all seven of the world??s most advanced and experimental jet fighters. 
 TARGETED STRATEGIES IN DIVERGlNG MARKETS Despite the large installed base of Sega Genesis and Super NES game consoles in the US. market, industry sales of 16-bit software cartridges declined approximately 30% last year. In this maturing market, our strategy has been to introduce fewer products each year, Focus on our proven Franchise properties, and advertise them aggressively to maximize sales in the peak selling seasons. For fiscal 1996 we had one of our strongest lineups ever, with Maddm NFL 96, NBA Live 96, NHL 96, College Football USA 96, and triple play baseball 96 all hitting the best-seller lists. As a result, we increased our 16-bit market share from 15% to 17% according to independent industry sources. In fiscal 1997 we expect the decline in the 16-bit cartridge market to accelerate as the replacement market of 32-bit platforms becomes established. We will continue to pursue a selective release strategy backed by high-impact advertising during the holiday season. 
 The market for interactive entertainment software for PCs is broader demographically than the cartridge market, and we believe it will grow steadily at a rate of approximately 15% to 30% next year. Our strategy is to create a rich variety of CD-ROM titles in the major PC categories, including strategy games, simulations. action adventures, and interactive movies, while bringing to due PC the sports properties EA has successfully developed for other game formats. 
 This strategy worked well during fiscal 1996. Revenues from PC-CD products nearly doubled to $141 million in fiscal 1996, compared to $72 million the year before. EA best-sellers for PC included Wing Commander Wing Commander ROAD TRACK the Need for speed, US Navy Fighters, Advanced tactical Fighters, and crusader No Remorse We also successfully moved most of our popular sports properties to PC, including FIFA soccer 96, NBA live 96, NHL. 95, and PGA TOUR 96. 
 The greatest challenge we faced during fiscal 1996 was creating products for the PlayStation and the Sega Saturn. Both systems arrived in the US?? market in 1995, midway through our fiscal year By the end of the calendar year they had a worldwide installed base of approximately six million units, with the majority of those machines in Japan. The 32-bit microcomputer technology in the PlayStation and the Sega Saturn provides much improved graphics, animation, and sound compared to earlier game consoles. At the same time, the more powerful microprocessors present a significantly more complex programming challenge to software developers. 
 During fiscal 1996 we successfully launched 13 products for the PlayStation, including such core Franchises as FIFA soccer 96, NBA Live 96! Road Rash and ROAD TRACK presents the need for speed and finished the fiscal year with three products on the best seller ESQ?? In fact, of the sports products released on the PlayStation this year, FIFA soccer 96, NBA Live 96 and PGA TOUR 96, each was the leading product in its category. However, we did not meet our ambitious goals for the 32-bit market segment primarily because of unanticipated delays in developing and releasing products on these new systems, which specifically affected our extremely popular football and hockey properties. We believe the initial development and manufacturing issues we experienced with the introduction of the PlayStation and the Sega Saturn to the U.S. market are now resolved. We expect to move forward aggressively to establish a leading market share position in this fast-growing segment. 
 LOOKING AHEAD Our primary focus for the next year is to release high quality products for 32-bit game systems and multimedia PCs. We expect that 80% to 90% of our new products will be released on these platforms and will generate 60% to 70% of the Company published revenues. Similar to fiscal 1996, we expect more revenues to come from PC-based products than any other single platform. In the steadily expanding PC-CD segment, our objective is to extend our market share leadership in Europe, improve our strong market share position in the U.S., and move aggressively into the emerging Asian markets. 
 We plan to substantially improve our development schedule predictability for the PlayStation and the Sega Saturn products in fiscal 1997, with a major emphasis on our sports properties. We have already instituted more Precise resource allocation, tighter management of sched- ule milestones, and more in-depth assessment of the technical challenges involved in developing products for the new systems. Our ultimate goal for our 32-bit sports products is to build a market share comparable to what we earlier achieved on the 16-bit cartridge systems. We are also focused on creating simulation and strategy products with enough originality and popularity to become enduring franchise properties in the future. 
 Internationally, we will continue to build our direct distribution capacity. We expect to generate more than 50% of fiscal 1997 revenues outside of North America, up from 42% in fiscal 1996 and 32% in fiscal 1995. 
 We also expect to launch EA into the online multi-player arena, first with a role-playing adventure game designed to allow players around the world to interact in real time. As fiscal 1997 began, hundreds of people participated in a live Internet test of ultima online a multiplayer version of our popular Ultima series. We envision a time when EA customers can go online from any location, at any time, and join other players in EA strategy games, sports tournaments, and combat simulations. This is one of the most exciting developments in interactive entertainment, and Electronic Arts will be at the forefront. 
 I want to thank the extraordinary group of talented, hard-working people at EA who consistently merge compelling content with cutting-edge technology and customer-focused distribution. I would also like to thank you, our stockholders, for your support as Electronic Arts extends its international leadership in one of the world's most exciting entertainment industries. 
"
Doc35,ea ,2000,"During fiscal year 2000 Electronic Arts (EA) significantly enhanced its strategic position in the interactive entertainment category. While continuing to create the world??s greatest games on current platforms, EA has taken action to capitalize on technology breakthroughs and to help insulate the company from the cyclical economics that historically impact our industry during console transitions. Despite the console market transition beginning sooner than expected, we continued to grow revenues and profits during the year. We reached an important agreement with America Online, Inc. to be the exclusive provider of games on all AOL sites, increased market share on the critical PC platform, and positioned ourselves for leadership on the next generation of console platforms.  By managing the industry??s best development talent, creating strong franchise properties, and expanding our global distribution, we increased revenues and profits in a challenging market environment. Including the results of our new online division, EA.com,(1) consolidated net revenues increased 16 percent to $1,420 million. Consolidated net income, on an as-reported basis, including goodwill and one-time acquisition related charges, increased 60 percent to $117 million; while consolidated diluted earnings per share increased 53 percent to $1.76. 
 Consolidated pro-forma net income,(2) excluding goodwill and one-time acquisition-related charges in both years, increased 14 percent to $130 million. Consolidated pro-forma diluted earnings per share(2) increased 8 percent to $1.95. Our core business, which excludes the results of EA.com, grew pro-forma net revenues(3) 16 percent to $1,401 million. Pro-forma core net income(4) increased 37 percent to $164 million for the core business. 
 strongly positioned on key platforms We had multiple successes on the PC platform in fiscal year 2000. SimCity 3000?? and Command & Conquer??: Tiberian Sun?? each achieved No. 1 status on the PC best-seller list. For calendar year 1999, both products finished in the Top Ten, representing our best performance ever on the PC platform. In addition, we created an outstanding new franchise property The Sims?? which was named Game of the Year by the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences. 
 On the console platforms, our EA SPORTS?? titles maintained a leadership position, with Madden NFL?? 2000 once again winning the all-important football battle in North America. FIFA 2000 dominated the European ??football?? category, with NBA Live 2000, NHL?? 2000, NASCAR??2000, Triple Play 2001, Knockout Kings??2000 and Tiger Woods PGA TOUR?? Golf 2000 all leading in their respective categories. In addition, we bolstered our impressive motorsports lineup by signing a longterm license with Formula One. In March 2000, we released our first F1 products, rounding out the strongest collection of sports properties in our industry. We also secured an exclusive five-year agreement for the James Bond license and will release The World Is Not Enough on multiple platforms in the coming year. In 1999, Tomorrow Never Dies was one of the leading products on the PlayStation?? platform. 
 We further strengthened our Studio organization with the acquisition of DreamWorks Interactive, LLC. DreamWorks developed and published Jurassic Park: The Lost World and released Medal Of Honor??, a best-selling title during the most recent holiday season. We expect to have an ongoing collaboration with DreamWorks SKG, allowing us to create unique and commercially viable content for the interactive entertainment market. 
 Given this unique combination of assets, we believe that Electronic Arts is well positioned to navigate successfully through the transition to the next generation of console technology. Equally important, we view cyclical transition as an opportunity to strengthen and streamline the company, and to clearly establish EA as the market leader of the future. 
 investing for online leadership While still in its infancy, analysts project that online interactive entertainment will generate revenues of up to $2 billion in 2002(,5) an increase of more than 500 percent from $300 million in 1999. During the year, we made a significant investment in EA.com, which we believe will help to establish us as the leading provider of interactive entertainment in the emerging online market. EA.com pro-forma revenues(1) totaled $21 million in fiscal year 2000, with investment spending of $63 million, resulting in a pro-forma net loss(6) of $34 million. We expect that the online portion of our business will continue to generate a net loss in the coming fiscal year, as we position ourselves for this significant new opportunity. 
 In November 1999, we announced a wide-ranging strategic alliance with America Online. The agreement provides Electronic Arts with control of all programming, pricing and promotion on the AOL?? games channel. This is an unprecedented arrangement, which provides EA with immediate access to nearly 60 million online consumers including 22 million AOL subscribers. We have created a separate class of stock, Class B Common Stock (Tracking Stock), to track the performance of the EA.com business, and plan to take this security public at a later date. AOL owns 10 percent of the Class B Common Stock with a warrant for an additional 5 percent ownership. News Corp., as partial consideration for the sale of their Kesmai development group to EA, received 5 percent of the tracking stock. We believe that the partnership with AOL, News Corp., EA Studios and our existing publishing organization is a formidable combination that will facilitate market leadership in this rapidly growing segment of the Internet. 
 strategic goals for the future As we look ahead, we are focused on four strategic initiatives. 
 First, our goal is to be the market leader on the next generation of video game consoles, which includes Sony??s PlayStation??2 computer entertainment system, Microsoft??s Xbox??, and Nintendo??s Dolphin. We shipped our first product for the PlayStation 2 console in Japan in May 2000. Additional titles will be released beginning in the Fall of 2000 in conjunction with the launch of the PlayStation 2 console in North America and Europe. 
 Second, our objective is to be the leading publisher worldwide on the PC platform. We currently hold that position in Europe and Asia Pacific and intend to increase our share in fiscal year 2001. In North America, we believe we can move into the leadership position with a strong portfolio of titles that includes The Sims, Command & Conquer: Red Alert??2, American McGee??s Alice??, Black & White??, The World Is Not Enough, and a full line up of EA SPORTS products. 
 Third, we intend to be the leading provider of interactive entertainment on the Internet. The ability to create compelling content in our Studios and our new EA.com division, along with the unparalleled distribution and reach provided through our partnership with AOL, uniquely positions us for success in this environment. We plan to launch the EA.comSM site in summer 2000, with the full service operational in calendar 2001. 
 Fourth, but most importantly, we strive to be the No. 1 ??people company?? in the entertainment industry. Without doubt, our employees are the lifeblood of our company. They create the award-winning products, market and distribute them more effectively than any competitor, and provide the support functions that enable EA to be the premier company in our industry. It is imperative that our people are well trained, strongly motivated, recognized for their accomplishments and highly productive. We take this challenge seriously and are constantly working to enhance the quality of our organization. 
 We have every confidence that we can achieve each of these strategic objectives, and, in doing so, that we will continue to grow and prosper not only during the current console transition period but also in the years ahead. 
 I would like to acknowledge our employees for their tireless efforts, commitment to excellence and dedication to making EA the worldwide leader in our industry. 
 Finally, I thank our customers and stockholders for their continuing support and trust in Electronic Arts. 
"
Doc36,ea ,2001,"Fiscal year 2001 was both a challenging and exciting period for our company and for the industry. The transition f rom the current generation of game consoles to next generation systems continued, marked by the debut of the first entry in the next wave of new technology ? the PlayStation??2 computer entertainment system from Sony. Nintendo and Microsoft will launch new platforms later this year, creating unprecedented levels of competition, creativity and excitement for consumers. Most importantly, this provides a unique opportunity for Electronic Arts to drive revenue and pro fit growth as we move through the next technology cycle. In conjunction with steady increases in the PC market, plus the significant new opportunity in online gaming, we believe Electronic Arts is poised to achieve new levels of success and leadership in the interactive entertainment category.  In FY01, consolidated net revenue decreased 6.9 percent to $1,322 million. As a result of our investment in building the leading Internet gaming website, consolidated net income decreased $128 million to a consolidated net loss of $11 million, while consolidated diluted earnings per share decreased $0.96 to a diluted loss per share of $0.08. Pro forma consolidated net income and earnings per share, excluding goodwill, non-cash and one-time charges were $6 million and $0.04, respectively, for the year. 
 LEADERSHIP ON FOUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES EA has established four key strategic initiatives by which we measure our perf o rmance. We pledged to become the number one publisher on next generation consoles, number one on the PC platform, and the number one provider of interactive entertainment on the Internet. Our fourth key initiative is to be the number one ??People Company?? in the entertainment industry. 
 I would like to share with you our assessment of how we performed against each of these strategic initiatives in fiscal year 2001. 
 Strategic Initiative #1   Leadership on Next Generation Consoles Although early in the game, EA has carved out the leading position on the PlayStation 2 console, the first of the next generation consoles. In North America, we achieved a 44 percent market share for this platform during the introductory period through December and maintained a 40 percent share during the March quarter based on dollar sales. In total, we released fifteen new products for this system in less than a six-month period, making EA by far the most prolific publisher for the PlayStation 2 console. We led the best-seller charts with titles and franchises like Madden NFL??, NBA Live and SSX, our new snowboarding game. Both Madden and SSX have already sold more than one million units each on this new platform. In Europe, we estimate we achieved a 35 percent share across all territories on the PlayStation 2 for the calendar year ended December 2000, based on dollar sales, led by FIFA Soccer and SSX. In Japan, our FIFA Soccer World Championship reached number one on the charts, and we firmly established ourselves as the leading US-based publisher in this market. While we do not expect to sustain market share at this level on the PlayStation 2, we have demonstrated our strength in development and publishing and firmly established ourselves as a leader on this console. We have announced support for both the Xbox?? video game console from Microsoft and the Nintendo GameCube??, which will debut later this year. In summary, we succeeded well beyond our expectations on the PlayStation 2; we believe we are well positioned to succeed on Xbox and Nintendo GameCube; and we fully expect to achieve our goal of leadership on next generation consoles. 
 Strategic Initiative #2  Leadership on the PC Platform On the PC platform we made tremendous strides. We grew market share by more than five points in North America, ending the March quarter in the number one position with a 21.6 percent share based on dollar sales. In Europe, we estimate we were the leading company for calendar 2000 with more than a 24 percent share based on dollar sales. In Asia Pacific, we estimate we led in all territories, and we moved to the number two market share position in Japan for the fiscal year. For the second year in a row EA published the number one title in the market  The Sims?? in calendar 2000 and SimCity 3000?? in calendar 1999. The Sims is a global phenomenon; it appeals to a very broad demographic of users, including men, women and children, along with both hard - core and casual gamers. We have sold more than four million units of the core product, and nearly seven million units total when you include expansion packs and data disks. It has become our most important wholly-owned intellectual property, and we plan to continue to develop this franchise with additional expansion packs and an online version in FY02. In addition, we had great success with products like Command & Conquer??: Red Alert?? 2 and Black & White??, both of which have sold more than one million units worldwide to date. 
 Strategic Initiative #3   Be the Leading Provider of Interactive Entertainment on the Internet In the online space we launched EA.com in FY01 and continue to make strong progress towards our goal of leadership in this medium. We acquired Pogo Corporation in Q4, which gives us the ??stickiest?? site on the web for popular entertainment. During the month of March we had more than nine million unique visitors to the EA.com site. Users logged more than 1.7 billion minutes on the EA.com/pogo.comS web sites in March, making this the fifth most heavily trafficked site on the Internet. In the summer we will launch Majestic??, the highly anticipated online thriller, followed by Motor City Online, Earth and Beyond?? and The Sims Online?? later in the fiscal year. We are developing a rich content portfolio; we intend to validate the subscription model for online entertainment; and we are committed to making EA.com a profitable component of our overall business. 
 Strategic Initiative #4   Number One ??People Company?? in the Entertainment Industry We are on track to achieving this goal. We know that industry leadership is predicated on attracting and developing the best talent. We strive to create an environment where people want to work and where great careers are realized. 
 When it comes to re c ruiting talent, we are widely recognized for combining an innovative web-based strategy with a ??high touch?? approach. In just over a year, the career site on our corporate home page has registered more than 50,000 candidates, forming a private talent pool for EA??s ongoing recruitment. 
 We must also retain our best people. We??ve developed EA University to enhance our technical and m a nagement skills. Our proprietary Emerging Leader Program provides management insight and broad business skills to employees who show potential for next generation leadership. We??ve also launched an innovative cross-functional program with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The Creative Leadership Program brings academics and developers together in workshops on narrative, art, and design. In addition, we listen to our people through our Talk Back o rganization feedback process, which allows us to stay in touch with the ever-changing needs of our workforce. 
 These highlighted efforts coupled with industry-leading compensation and reward practices, value-based management practices, and the most up-to-date work environments, are making us a #1 People Company. 
 LOOKING AHEAD: HITS AND INNOVATION historically, the console market has grown by 50 percent or more with each new generation of technology. By most estimates, the next generation of 128-bit machines could develop an installed base of more than 200 million systems worldwide. More hard w a re units translate into more software sales. Also, as gameplay, graphics and audio improve to match the enhanced technology, software tie ratios (the number of software units sold per hardware system) are likely to increase in the future. These are all clear indications of organic growth in our industry. 
 As new entries from Nintendo and Microsoft heat up the competition in console gaming, and as online gaming continues to grow, EA??s primary goal will be to expand on the market leadership we achieved in FY01. Within our industry, EA??s scale allows us the unique ability to leverage intellectual properties across multiple platforms and publish them around the globe. 
 EA??s fundamental strategy is based on creating new hits and innovative products. In FY01, titles like The Sims and SSX along with our lineup of franchises under our EA SPORTS?? brand  Madden NFL??, FIFA Soccer, NHL??, NBA Live, Tiger Woods PGA TOUR??Golf, Triple Play Baseball??, Formula One, Knockout Kings?? and NASCAR?? inspired loyal consumers and drew new audiences to the fun of video games. In FY02 we will release a full slate of potential new hits including NBA STREET, James Bond 007??Agent Under Fire??, Pirates of Skull Cove?? and the first in a series of multiple products based upon the Harry Potter?? property, which EA has licensed exclusively for the video game category. 
 This strategy of hits and innovation will usher in a new age of video gaming. As our core consumers mature and younger gamers enter the market, we??re also seeing greater numbers of women drawn to our products. As technology improves and gameplay adopts deeper story lines and character development, the evolution of video games is accelerating. Interactive entertainment has truly become mainstream entertainment. EA intends to remain at the fore f ront of this exciting and rapidly expanding industry. 
 As always, I want to thank and acknowledge our customers, stockholders and employees for their commitment and ongoing support of Electronic Arts.

Doc37,ea ,2002,"In fiscal 2002 we significantly improved our performance versus the previous year and strengthened our position as the industry leader. EA sold more games, captured more market share and generated more revenue than ever before.We capitalized on our strong start in the new console cycle, enhanced our PC business, focused our online operation and grew our portfolio of game franchises. Most importantly, we positioned EA to maintain leadership for the years that lie ahead.  Our success is predicated on long-range strategic planning, accurate forecasting, effective risk management and precise execution. EA measures every decision with an understanding that our industry performs in cycles tied to the launch of new hardware platforms.We have exited the very challenging transition period from 32-bit and 64-bit systems to next generation technology that will provide the basis for continued revenue growth and increased profitability. 
 In the late 1990s, EA made three key strategic decisions: 
 We predicted that Sony??s PlayStation??2 computer entertainment system would capture global leadership in the next generation of game consoles. As a result, we concentrated on mastering development for that system, aggressively supporting its launch and becoming the number one publisher for that platform. 
 We believed that next generation consoles from Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft would trigger unprecedented growth and make video games a mainstream force in entertainment.We, therefore, focused our resources on building technology tools and libraries that would allow us to create new products on multiple platforms in a cost-effective manner. 
 We understood that as the company moved through the difficult console transition, we could help insulate our business by generating greater revenue from our PC games and our global distribution capability.We made it a priority to build and acquire new intellectual properties that would drive market share growth on the PC. 
 Our strategic planning and effective execution through this most recent console transition allowed EA to generate outstanding results in fiscal 2002. 
 FISCAL 2002: A YEAR OF LEADERSHIP, GROWTH AND STRATEGIC POSITIONING 
 In the past year, EA strengthened its position as the worldwide leader in interactive entertainment.We grew our business across all markets; we provided compelling software that powered consumer migration to next generation consoles; we strengthened our powerful sports franchises; we developed important new properties; and we signed long-term co-publishing agreements with significant new partners. 
 We increased consolidated net revenue by 30 percent to over $1.7 billion and improved consolidated net income by $113 million to $102 million. Revenues were up in all territories, and in North America we celebrated a major milestone with revenue exceeding $1 billion for the first time. Revenue from our core business increased by 29 percent to over $1.6 billion.With higher sales and focused management of our expenses, operating income from our core business increased $163 million, or 132 percent, over the prior year. Pro forma* net income from our core business increased 106 percent to $217 million, and pro forma net income margin increased five points to 13 percent.We increased EA.com revenue by 83 percent to $77 million and by the fourth quarter had reduced our quarterly pro forma operating expenses by over $16 million compared to the peak quarter in the prior year. 
 EA??s strong performance in fiscal 2002 was made possible by the depth and breadth of our product portfolio and the strength of our worldwide distribution system. Among a year of many blockbusters, three titles stood out: 
 Harry Potter and the Sorcerer??s Stone??   Based on the books and movie, this first game in our multiyear agreement with Warner Bros. became the fastest selling title in EA history. Developed for just four platforms, we sold 9.3 million units worldwide in less than five months. In fiscal 2003, our plans for a new Harry Potter?? game will include next generation consoles for the first time. 
 The Sims??   This wholly-owned franchise is now the best-selling PC game of all time and is popular around the world. Our most valuable intellectual property will continue to deliver significant revenue and high margins in the coming years. 
 Madden NFL??2002   This powerhouse franchise sold over 4.5 million units across eight platforms and was the number one selling console game in North America in fiscal 2002. 
 FISCAL 2002 PERFORMANCE MEASURED BY FOUR KEY INITIATIVES At EA, we??ve established four strategic initiatives for guiding our success.These initiatives are as simple as they are ambitious. Our goals are to be the number one software publisher on next generation consoles; to be number one on the PC; and to be number one online.The fourth key initiative is to make EA the number one people company for high-performance teams and individuals. 
 INITIATIVE #1: LEADERSHIP ON NEXT GENERATION CONSOLES EA was the undisputed global leader on next generation consoles in fiscal 2002. Across all systems we were number one in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. In Japan, we were the leading Western publisher in a market typically dominated by local companies and titles. 
 On the PlayStation 2 console, which established a decisive lead among the new consoles, EA was the number one publisher with 28 percent market share and five of the top ten titles in the U.S. in fiscal 2002. Standout titles included Madden NFL 2002, NBA Street, James Bond 007 in?? Agent Under Fire??, FIFA Soccer 2002 and Final Fantasy??X, which we distribute in North America for our joint venture partner SquareSoft. 
 The year??s biggest headline was the launch of two new and impressive game consoles, the Xbox?? video game system from Microsoft and the Nintendo GameCube??. Between the launch in November to the end of our fiscal year, EA was the number one independent publisher on both the Xbox and Nintendo GameCube in the U.S. 
 By year end, EA stood as the most prolific company on next generation platforms, releasing 18 titles on the PlayStation 2 console, 10 on the Xbox and five on the Nintendo GameCube. 
 INITIATIVE #2: LEADERSHIP ON THE PC EA is the number one entertainment software publisher on the PC in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific, and number two in Japan.We earned a 22 percent market share on the PC in the U.S. and had four of the top five titles in fiscal 2002. 
 The key driver of this success is the ongoing popularity of The Sims.The core product has sold in excess of 6.5 million units and was the best-selling PC game for the second year in a row an extraordinary achievement. The Sims has inspired four expansion packs Livin?? Large, House Party, Hot Date and Vacation to bring total franchise sales to more than 15 million units to date. 
 EA increased PC market share across all territories with the release of other popular titles including Medal of Honor Allied Assault??, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer??s Stone and Command & Conquer Renegade 
 INITIATIVE #3: LEADERSHIP ONLINE In fiscal 2002, we increased EA.comSMrevenue 83 percent; we reduced spending and focused on operational efficiencies; we successfully integrated games and customers from our ad-driven Pogo??site; and we zeroed in on the development of core products such as Earth & Beyond?? and the highly anticipated The Sims Online??. We are working hard to reach profitability and are targeting our first break-even quarter in fiscal 2003 when we release The Sims Online. 
 Based on total minutes served, EA.com is the fourth largest website behind only AOL, MSN and Yahoo!. At the end of our fiscal year, EA.com had more than 13 million unique monthly visitors who spent in excess of 4.6 billion minutes on the site 41 percent of the total U.S. online gaming market. 
 INITIATIVE #4: TO BE THE NUMBER ONE PEOPLE COMPANY FOR HIGH-PERFORMANCE TEAMS AND INDIVIDUALS Our strategy for achieving this goal is to work with the very best talent, to provide training and career development and to offer rewarding compensation and benefit programs.This initiative has enhanced the quality of our organization and has attracted the attention of creative people in other sectors of the entertainment industry. Our human resources function has become a strategic weapon for EA attracting, hiring and retaining the very best talent in our industry.We are committed to making EA the best place to work for people that share our passion for interactive entertainment and performance excellence. 
 BUILDING ON LEADERSHIP IN FISCAL 2003 AND INTO THE NEXT TECHNOLOGY CYCLE Our management team has navigated several cycles of technology transition.We made the difficult decisions that were required to move EA successfully through a challenging period. Now we are well positioned to capture the growth of the new cycle. Revenues from our core packaged goods business will increase, operating margins will expand and our EA.com business will reach its first break-even quarter in fiscal 2003. 
 In fiscal 2003 EA will build on solid franchises and innovate with new titles. Dramatic enhancements and new functionality will appear in blockbuster sports products like FIFA Soccer, Madden NFL Football and NBA Live. Games will be inspired by films like Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, The Lord of the Rings and James Bond. Stunning new versions of classics like SimCity??, Need for Speed?? and Command & Conquer?? will be released. Distribution agreements with entertainment giants like LEGO System A/S, Fox Interactive, LucasArts, SquareSoft and Capcom will enrich our product portfolio. The Sims Online will allow subscribers to create characters, build environments and live out fantasies in a persistent state world. 
 We have long believed that interactive entertainment would grow from a niche market into mainstream entertainment now we are helping to drive that reality. Revenues from a successful game can rival or exceed those of a successful film, and our demographics are becoming as broad as the audience for television. 
 As the industry moves into the ??sweet spot?? of this cycle, EA management is already beginning to plan for the next generation of technology.We are building our team of talented and experienced people, defining our strategic direction and working towards our goal of making EA one of the most exciting and profitable entertainment companies of the 21st century. 
 Finally, I want to thank our employees, business partners, customers and stockholders for their commitment and support of Electronic Arts. 
"
Doc38,ea ,2003,"In fiscal 2003, Electronic Arts grew net revenue by 44 percent to $2.5 billion and net income by 212 percent to $317 million. Earnings per share were $2.17. We generated $714 million of operating cash flow and finished the year with $1.6 billion in cash.  Rarely in technology or entertainment does the reality match the hype. However, EA continues to meet or exceed the expectations set at the start of this business cycle. The installed base of game consoles is tracking well ahead of the previous generation. Tie ratios of games sold for every unit of hardware are higher and new products are challenging all assumptions about the age and gender of our industry demographics. 
 During the fiscal year, 22 of our titles sold more than one million units and five sold in excess of four million units-an industry record. Worldwide, we are the leading independent publisher on each of the major consoles; we are the number one publisher of PC titles; and we are the leading provider of games on the Internet. 
 EA was recognized by Fortune Magazine as one of the loo Best Companies to Work For in the U.S. The Times in the U.K. and The Globe and Mail in Canada passed similar judgment on our organizations in those countries. We were placed on the 5&P 500, made the Forbes 500, and Business Week rated us number 17 on their list of the 50 Best Performers for the year. 
 Not every goal is achieved and not every game is a hit. However, EA's consistent performance continues to separate us from the competition. Our scale and commitment to developing games for multiple platforms, to focusing resources on franchises with global appeal, and to investing in technology, tools and libraries provide us the opportunity to take creative risks which help drive future growth. 
 While EA is the leader in a thriving industry, our success is not a coincidence. We begin with exhaustive research and take careful measure of our competition. We partner with top licensors and foster our own intellectual properties. We ask tough questions and expect every studio and publishing group to measure progress against exacting standards for achievement and excellence. 
 SETTING OBJECTIVES AS A ROAD MAP FOR SUCCESS We began fiscal 2003 by establishing six key priorities that created a road map to continued industry leadership for EA. 
 FY03 CHALLENGE #1: Drive EA's Harry Potter Franchise Beyond the Record-Breaking Performance of the Previous Year This was an ambitious goal-but it is one we met. During fiscal 2002, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone- became the fastest selling game in EA history. To top that performance with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets;our studio developed an outstanding game on seven platforms and in 31 languages. Our publishing team then launched the game in more than ioo countries on the same day as the release of the Warner Brothers film. The hard work paid off-by the end of fiscal 2003, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets had generated more than $250 million in revenue, a 22 percent improvement over the prior year. 
 FY03 CHALLENGE #2: Restore FIFA as the World's Number One Soccer Franchise introduced in 1994, FIFA Soccer is one of EA's most powerful sports franchises with lifetime revenue of more than $i billion. But competitors were threatening FIFA's leadership. To add to the challenge, EA's 2002 FIFA World Cup-game sold over two million units in the June quartermaking the October launch of a second soccer title even more daunting. To give FIFA an edge, our developers and market researchers met with critics and fans to rediscover what made FIFA great. The resulting game sold more than four million units and was once again the world's best selling soccer title. 
 FY03 CHALLENGE #3: Focus on Growing Intellectual Properties Wholly Owned by EA We've placed a strategic priority on creating and nurturing high-margin properties owned by EA. Fiscal 2003 was a banner year for EA intellectual property, with new games and expansion to new platforms. Our World War II title, Medol of Honor Frontline'; sold more than 4.5 million units. The Sims, an EA product line that has sold more than 25 million units, introduced two expansion packs and an online game for the PC. When The Sims launched on consoles, we showed the world that this was not just a PC phenomenon, but a franchise with multi-platform versatility. We finished the year with a highly successful release of Command & Conquer'MGenerols, another intellectual property with global appeal. 
 FY03 CHALLENGE #4: Win the Holiday Season with Flawless Global Execution in a period of 47 days from October 15 to November 30, EA launched 32 games on a total of seven platforms and sold them in as many as 31 languages and more than ioo countries. No other company could do that; few of them would even try. When the December quarter ended, EA had captured five of the top io titles on the PlayStation2 console, three of the top io on the Xbox'console, two of the top io on the Nintendo GameCube'and five of the top io on the PC in North America. During this period, EA set an industry record by generating more than $1.2 billion in revenue in a single quarter. 
 FY03 CHALLENGE #5: Prove the Online Subscription Business Last year, EA published two subscription-based online games for the PC-Earth & Beyond-and The Sims Online' Both were high quality games that received positive reviews from critics. However, neither met our expectations for sales and subscription. Despite the disappointment, the experience has not diminished our willingness to take creative risks. We are very proud of these games. 
 In fiscal 2003, EA consolidated the operations of our online division into our core operations. We took a pre-tax charge of $67 million as a result of impaired assets and restructuring costs in the online division. We're not abandoning online games-far from it. However, going forward our online activities will be more closely integrated into our console and PC business. 
 We learned some hard but useful lessons from this experience. In hindsight, we spent too much, and we did it too early in the cycle. However, we believe that in the coming months and years, online play will become an increasingly important feature in console games. While we don't expect console online play to reach mass market proportions on this generation of technology, more than 450,000 fans have already registered to play Madden NFCFootball and NBA LIVE online on the PlayStation 2 console. 
 FY03 CHALLENGE #6: Build on the Leadership of EA SPORTS' Sports games are the core of EA's business, providing a recurring annual revenue stream and powerful recognition for our trademark around the world. Title by title, year by year, we have built a commanding lead. 
 Fiscal 2003 began with competitors, critics and even diehard fans whispering that the EA SPORTS brand could lose its leading position in the football, basketball, racing and soccer categories. But when those seasons ended, we not only held our position, we actually grew our sports business across all major platforms. EA's Madden NFL Football, NCAAFootball, FIFA Soccer, NBA LIVE and NASCAR Thunder-franchises all achieved lopsided victories and confirmed that when faced with competition, EA SPORTS would not only defend, but extend its leadership. It was an extraordinary achievement-and one that set a new standard for teamwork and performance at EA. 
 A ROAD MAP FOR FY04 AND BEYOND Rest assured, we have a new and equally ambitious set of goals that define our road map for fiscal year 2004. Build on EA's intellectual property portfolio with games like Medol of Honor-Rising Sun, The Sims 2 and SSX3. Invest in development of new, wholly owned game properties. Increase EA SPORTS worldwide market leadership. Fully exploit EA titles tied to major movie licenses: The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and )omes Bond. Leverage the advantage of EA's online experience and infrastructure. Attack new opportunities with investments in people, process and technology. 
 Our preparation and vision take us far beyond the current generation of console systems. Today, many of EA's top engineers and business planners are building models and strategies for the new technology, new audiences and new game experiences that will extend EA's leadership and reshape interactive entertainment. 
 We see more powerful consoles, faster PC's, high-definition television, theatre-quality sound and broadband connectivity- new game systems that will take us beyond anything we've seen, felt or experienced in the past. 
 Imagine Madden NFL Football or The Sims in that environment! At the heart of the revolution in digital entertainment is the software-the games, movies and music that make the technology come alive. In our industry, each new generation of technology provides developers with an enhanced canvas for creating more compelling entertainment experiences. Game platforms-faster consoles and PC's-create fantastic opportunities, but it's the software that provides the magic. 
 At EA, we're the world's leading developer and publisher of interactive entertainment-the software that breathes life into the hardware. Our global scale and reach, our ability to adapt and plan, our commitment to empower the very best people with the very best place to work, keep us on a path to our ultimate goal: To be the greatest entertainment company... ever! 
 To conclude, I would like to thank our employees, customers, business partners and stockholders for their ongoing commitment and support of Electronic Arts.
